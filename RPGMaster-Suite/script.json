    "description": "The RPGMaster Suite API is the loader for, part of, and the API that responds to the !cmd Mod call in the RPGMaster suite of APIs for Roll20, replacing CommandMaster (legacy installs of CommandMaster will continue to be supported).  It manages the initialisation of a Campaign to use the RPGMaster APIs, communication and command syntax updates between the APIs and, most importantly for the DM, easy menu-driven setup of Tokens and Character Sheets to work with the APIs.\n\n[RPGMasterSuite API Documentation](https://wiki.roll20.net/Script:CommandMaster) \n[RPGMaster Documentation](https://wiki.roll20.net/RPGMaster) \n### Getting Started\n1. Run `!cmd --initialise` and add the player macros created to the Macro Bar, then\n2. Select tokens and use the `Token Setup` macro bar button just created to add all relevant Action Buttons to the token(s) (plus set the tokens/Characters up in any other way provided in the menu displayed) \n3. Once steps 1 & 2 have been done, the players and DM can then use the buttons displayed at the top of the screen when their character's token is selected to perform all actions needed in normal play.",
