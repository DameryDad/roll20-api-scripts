 * 
 * The goal of this script is to provide a shared library of functions
 * available to all RPGmaster APIs (and anyone else who wants to use them)
 * 
 * v0.1.0  28/03/2022 Initial version.
 * v0.2.1  08/04/2022 Initial RollTemplate parser.  Fixed checkCSdb() to create
 *                    ct- attributes for non-spec-ed abilities in a database.
 * v0.2.2  10/04/2022 Enhanced RollTemplate parser with image mgt & result display.
 *                    Updated doDisplayAbility() to additionally display non-db 
 *                    abilities (e.g. saving throws & attacks).
 * v0.2.3  01/05/2022 Added wider variety of RPGM templates for future expansion.
 *                    Extracted save calcs from functional APIs to lib to support

 *                    to correct player programmatically
 * v0.2.7  18/07/2022 Changed DBindex and abilityLookup() to point to DBnames[] array
 *                    for ability definitions unless they exist in char sheet DBs
 * v1.3.00 21/09/2022 First release to GitHub. Updated to delete old versions of 
 *                    standard character sheet databases.
 * v1.3.01 01/10/2022 Fix issue with database lookup if a character has a name that 
 *                    includes "spell" or "power" in their name. Added support for 
 *                    direct access to MU & PR spells, and/or other Magic Items as 
 *                    powers for characters and magic items.
 * v1.3.02 10/10/2022 Fixed errors in the coding of spells that requite a To-Hit roll 
 *                    but do damage rather than targeted magic. Changed initiative 
 *                    modifier char sheet field from comreact to custom field init-mod. 
 *                    Added spell as weapon flag to spell tables. Extended Ability 
 *                    object with new methods .data() & .hands().
 * v1.3.03 22/10/2022 Support for the Race Database.

 *                    for the Creatures database.
 * v1.4.01 28/11/2022 Support for the Fighting Styles database & creature setup. Allow
 *                    alphabetically indexed lists. Support %{DB|abilityMacro} in 
 *                    certain database definitions (e.g. Race/Creature). ShapeSpellbook()
 *                    moved to library. Extended String prototype with dbName() method.
 *                    Updated Attacks-DB with Throat Leech attacks. Added more creatures.
 *                    Adds and fixes to other database entries. Added deeper inheritance
 *                    chaining for race and class definitions.
 * v1.4.02 16/12/2022 More creature definitions, and supporting powers. Add ability to
 *                    specify weapons and armour for creatures with probability of
 *                    different sets. Also added ammo reuse type 2: becomes only possible
 *                    ammo of several for that weapon e.g. spitting snake venom, and
 *                    type 3: reduces in qty by 1, and all other ammo for same weapon
 *                    increases qty b 1.
 * v1.4.03 16/01/2023 Added Attack messages (similar to damage messages) using Ranged 
 *                    weapons notes field. Added ability for creature innate attacks to 
 *                    have damage roll before attack name so they work with CS buttons.
 *                    Fixed issue with abilityLookup() if ability name undefined.
 *                    Fixed issue with resolveData() if not defaulting values & ns: 
 *                    attribute not specified.
 * v1.4.04 16/01/2023 Added creature attkmsg & dmgmsg attributes to support messages to 
 *                    display with attack and damage rolls respectively. Added table & 
 *                    function to return calculated base Thac0. Made attrLookup() and 
 *                    getTokenValue() more robust vs. Character Sheet errors. Added 
 *                    support in getTokenValue() for redefined default token bars.
 *                    Added support for Character Sheet conversion. Gave Ammo its 
 *                    own lookup table capability.
 * v1.4.05 02/02/2023 Added code necessary to support new Rods, Staves & Wands, the new
 *                    Magic item class, and charges expended on successful hit. Fixed DB
 *                    entries that incorrectly use parentheses. Modified tableFind() to
 *                    compare field values using dbName(). Decouple AttackMaster and 
 *                    MagicMaster config values from parseOutput(). Better error handling
 *                    for several library functions. Moved caster level parsing to the library.
 * v1.4.06 09/04/2023 Updated MI database and Magic Database Help to add ability for bags to 
 *                    automatically create item-holding character sheet, and optionally for 
 *                    it to auto-populate initial items in the bag. Added "GM Info" as a 
 *                    possible line tag for RPGMspell & RPGMdefault Roll Templates, that 
 *                    is shown only if the GM is one of the recipients for the message.
 * v1.4.07 14/04/2023 Added more miscellaneous magic items. Updated Magic DB help. Added 
 *                    creatures for Bag of Tricks. Added new "discharging" MI type = charged but
 *                    cannot be split on pick or put. Added ItemQty field to hold current qty
 *                    of currently selected MI, held in MIct|max attribute on character sheet.
 * v1.4.08 20/04/2023 Updated MI database items to compress using %{...|...} syntax. Added new
 *                    magic items.
 * v1.5.01 17/05/2020 Fixed db reData parsing to only recover relevant text. Fixed reDataCharge 
 *                    parsing to accept + as a valid character. Fixed db Specs field parsing
 *                    to only recover relevant data. Added string trueCompare(txt) prototype.
 *                    Added  the dispName() string prototype to replace hyphens with spaces 
 *                    in names to display. Added improved handling of hidden magic items. 
 *                    Added "Looks Like" special template tag which will auto-hide an item and 
 *                    display only what it looks like until revealed. Default unknown magic item 
 *                    classes to be the same as "miscellaneous". Allow character_ids to be 
 *                    substituted for token_ids in calls to getCharacter(). Added the ability 
 *                    to alphabetise lists. Allow 'PW' to substitute 'POWER' in calls to caster() 
 *                    and related functions.
 * v1.5.02 08/06/2023 Fixed issue with checkCSdb() when parsing spells/powers that are innate 
 *                    and weaponised

	 * The fields object defines all the fields on a character sheet that the

	 * DO NOT change the name of each line in the object - this is what the API
	 * uses to find the name of the fields you want on the character sheet.
	 * ONLY CHANGE definitions within the '[...]' brackets.  Before the comma is
	 * the name of the field on the character sheet, and after the comma is the
	 * property used in the attribute object with that name.
	 * For REPEATING TABLE LINES: the table reference is in a definition named '..._table:'
	 * and consists of the reference name before the comma, and a flag defining if the
	 * first row of the table is the 'repeating_..._$0_' line (true) or a static field (false).
	 * Values in the table are then defined as separate definitions below the table
	 * reference definition e.g. 
	 *     MW_table: ['repeating_weapons',false],
	 *     MW_name:  ['weaponname','current'],
	 *     MW_speed: ['weapspeed','current'],

A single successful Disarm against a two-handed weapon user won\'t knock the weapon out of the wielder\'s hands; it will merely knock his weapon askew and make him take some time to recover, so he automatically loses initiative on his next round. However, two Disarm maneuvers successfully made against the character in the same round will knock the weapon loose.}}{{desc2=**Disadvantages**\nAs with single-weapon use, two-handed weapon technique has the drawback that the user cannot wear or use a shield, or gain the shield\'s AC bonus.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**\nYou can, by devoting a weapon proficiency to it, take a Style Specialization with Two-Hander Style.\nStyle Specialization with Two-Hander Style gives you a very specific benefit: When you\'re using a weapon two-handed, that weapon\'s Speed Factor is reduced by 3.\nThis is because when a fighter wields such a weapon with both hands on the hilt, he has more leverage on the blade and can move it faster. That\'s what Style Specialization in Two-Hander Style will do for the character: It teaches him how to use the weapon much faster and more aggressively than someone with less specialized training in the weapon.}}{{desc4=**One-Handed Weapons Used Two-Handed**\nSome players don\'t realize that many other one-handed weapons can also be used two-handed.

First, your attack penalty drops; before, it was a –2 with your primary weapon and –4 with your secondary, but with Specialization in Two-Weapon Style it becomes 0 with your primary weapon and a –2 with your secondary weapon. (If you\'re already ambidextrous, that penalty is 0 with primary weapon and 0 with secondary weapon). Second, you\'re allowed to use weapons of the same length in each hand, so you can, for example, wield two long swords.\nWhen fighting with two-weapon technique, you can choose for both weapons to try the same maneuver (for example, two strikes, or two disarms), or can have each try a different maneuver (one strike and one parry, one pin and one strike). If the two maneuvers are to be different, each receives a –1 attack penalty. \nThough rangers don\'t suffer the off-hand penalties for two-weapons use, they do not get a bonus to attack rolls if they devote a weapon proficiency slot to Two-Weapon Style. They do get the other benefit, of being able to use weapons of equal length.}}'},

If the character is disarmed, all he has to wield offensively is his shield, until he can get back to his weapon. If he is pinned in combat, he can\'t use his shield hand for grappling.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**\nIf you devote a weapon proficiency slot to specialization in Weapon and Shield Style, you receive one extra attack per round . . . only when using a shield on the shield-hand, that is. You can use that extra attack only for the Shield-Punch and Parry maneuvers.\nAs with the normal "Attacking with Two Weapons" rules (see the Player\'s Handbook, page 96), when striking with both hands in a single combat round, the character suffers a –2 to attack rolls with his weapon and a –4 to attack rolls with the Shield-Punch or Parry. (If you\'re ambidextrous, as described above under "Off-Hand Weapons Use," that\'s a –2 with weapon and –2 with shield.) If you devote a second weapon proficiency slot to Weapon and Shield Style Specialization, that penalty drops to with the weapon and –2 with the shield. (If you\'re ambidextrous, that penalty is 0 with weapon and 0 with shield).\nOn any round when you perform two maneuvers, you do not get the AC bonus for the shield for the rest of the round. If you swing your sword and perform a Shield-Punch in the same round, you do not get your shield\'s AC bonus if anyone attacks you later in the round.}}'},

They patrol the deeps of oceans and large inland waters, holding court beneath the waves. Often they are only seen when they frolic with dolphins in kelp beds.\nAquatic elves have gill slits much like fish, through which they process oxygen. They can also survive out of water for a short time by breathing. Their skin is typically silvergreen, matching the seaweed near their territory. Some possess a bluish tinge to their skin, although this is quite rare. Aquatic elves\' hair complements their skin and is also green or blue-green. The overall effect is one that makes them difficult to discern underwater, especially near kelp beds. Because of their coloring, they gain the typical elven ability to camouflage themselves in their natural environment. \nThese elves dislike sharks intensely. Because they fear the strange and terrible monsters that dwell in the sea, the aquatic elves and the dolphins have taken it upon themselves to keep at least some of it safe for those who travel across it. Thus, most seaside communities severely punish those who incur the wrath of sea elves. Only the most evil of people encourage the death of sea elves and dolphins.\nAlthough they may survive on land, aquatic elves prefer not to do so, for it causes them immense pain. They can walk on land for a number of days equal to their initial Constitution score. Every two days, all their ability scores decrease by –1 until the elves return to water. If a physical score (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) reaches 0, the elf dies. In salt water, the sea elf\'s attributes return to normal within 15 minutes. In fresh water, an elf merely stops losing his or her scores; they do not revert to normal until the elf enters salt water.}}'},

The Deep Gnomes are the most reticent of all the gnomish subraces, surviving in an extremely hostile environment entirely by their own wiles.\nUnlike their Rock Gnome cousins, they have no friendly neighbors to ally themselves with, forcing them to become entirely selfreliant. Only the few who have won their trust know that they are in many ways as social and artistic as other gnomes.\nWhy do they endure this frankly hostile environment?

The gem that most draws the interest and devotion of the Svirfneblin is the ruby, which is the predominant symbol of the race. The Deep Gnomes view these crimson stones with reverence approaching awe--so much so that they are never used for mundane practices such as ornamentation of garments, weapons, or armor. Rubies are reserved for sacred purposes and are often employed to decorate artifacts that are dedicated to the Svirfneblin gods. They are also favored by Deep Gnome monarchs, so much so that a Svirfneblin king or queen might have a full ring of rubies around his or her crown, with others of the precious stone set in the throne and sceptre.\nDeep Gnomes make and wield *stun darts*, throwing them to a range of 40 feet, with a +2 bonus to hit.

They dwell in large swaths of woodland, and--unlike the other gnomish subraces - prefer to dwell in houses that are at least partially above ground. They are creatures of nature far more than any of their cousins, and to those rare folks who meet them (and pass through the walls of initial shyness) they can prove to be steadfast allies and delightful companions.\nHowever, this subrace has not totally abandoned the love of gemstones that is so inherent to all gnomes. The emerald is the favored gem of the Forest Gnomes, no doubt because it most accurately reflects the healthy colors of their verdant homelands. While these gnomes can make excellent gemsmiths and jewelers, their work tends to be reverent images of the flowers, leaves, butterflies, and birds that are such a key part of the Forest Gnome\'s environment.\nThey share the stocky physique of the Rock and Tinker Gnome and the bulbous nose which is so characteristic of the race in general. They are the only gnomes inclined to wear beards and hair very long, and an older male is likely to have a beard that extends to within a few inches of the ground, and hair that, when unbound, falls all the way to his waist. These beards are a source of great pride to the venerable males, and they often trim them to a fine point or curl them into hornlike spikes that extend to either side.\nShy and timid when it comes to relations with other intelligent races, Forest Gnomes are very determined caretakers of their wooded domains. They are viewed with friendship by the animals of the forest and have developed a limited language of signs and sounds (similar to the Rock Gnome\'s \'speech\' with burrowing mammals) that allows them to communicate with these creatures, though without a great deal of detail.\nForest Gnomes are also very adept at protecting and caring for the plant life of their woods. They gather the nuts, fruit, and other bounty of the woods for sustenance, taking meat only infrequently--and always with a reverent ceremony to the spirit of the animal slain by the gnomish hunter. They despise the use of traps, never employing snares, pitfalls, or such traps themselves. When they encounter such devices set by humans or others, the Forest Gnomes have been known to rig the traps so that they capture (with a snare) or injure (as with a deadfall or pit trap) the trapper when he or she comes along to check for game. Generally, the trapper receives the same effect that his or her trap would have inflicted upon an animal.\nAside from meat, Forest Gnomes eat their food raw, though with a great deal of ceremony and politeness. Even a nut or a berry is only consumed after the tree or bush that gave it life has been properly, albeit silently, thanked. Needless to say, meals among the Forest Gnomes are very long, quiet affairs.\nThe most hated enemies of the Forest Gnomes are orcs, with troglodytes and lizardmen close behind. These creatures will be ruthlessly attacked and ambushed whenever they are encountered. Despite their shyness, Forest Gnomes have made friends with elves and halflings, though they tend to distrust humans and dwarves, who in their experience all-too-often view trees only as so much firewood.}}'},

Lacking any racial pride, they make virtues of cowardice, filth, witlessness, and dirty tricks. They live in abandoned strongholds, human villages, or in old mines and caves, in sewers, refuse dumps, or the slums of larger towns and cities. Elves will not tolerate their depravity.\nAn average gully dwarf is more slender than hill or mountain dwarves and has thin fingers. It is a status symbol for a gully dwarf to have a large pot belly for it displays his skill as a scavenger.\nSkin ranges in color from olive brown to light yellow, reminiscent of old parchment. It is often hard to determine a gully dwarf\'s skin color, however, because of the thick layers of dirt, scar tissue, boils, and scabs covering his skin.\nTheir beards and hair range from a dirty blond to a dull, indeterminate color. Female gully dwarves have hairy cheeks, but no beards. The eyes of both sexes are dull and lifeless, varying in color from watery blue through green to hazel.\nGullys are renowned for being stupid and obnoxious. A player character gully dwarf is an exception to the rule, being superior to others of his kind by virtue of his ability to think. However, players should not abuse this ability and allow their characters to concoct clever plans and schemes. Intelligence checks may be requested to see if the character could actually come up with such ideas. \nThey have high opinions of themselves and take themselves very seriously. They consider other dwarves to be "uppity" and "stuck up warts." Gully dwarves will lie, steal, bully, and cheat each other and every other race they encounter. If attacked, they grovel (see the power), whine, run away, or do whatever it takes to avoid injury. If combat cannot be avoided they will fight halfheartedly, usually with their eyes closed.\nBecause gully dwarves live in places that even orcs consider unattractive, they have few racial enemies. Scavenging most of their equipment from the junk heaps of other races, their "wealth" does not tempt others. Carrion crawlers have been known to turn up their tentacles rather than eat a gully dwarf.\nWhere do they come from? Other dwarves claim they are a cruel jest played by the gods on a mischievous stronghold of dwarves. Narvil believes that they are outcasts from a stronghold who later bred and infested the world. Perhaps they are the result of cross breeding between dwarves and gnomes, or dwarves and goblins. They may even have been the result of a vile experiment by an evil wizard. No one knows for sure, least of all the gullys themselves.\nThey are always treated with contempt, although they may be employed to perform menial tasks. Enclaves of gully dwarves could exist in most strongholds where they would be little better than slaves.\nGully dwarves are often of chaotic neutral alignment, but this diverse people may be of any alignment.}}'},

Where deep dwarves went downward, sundered dwarves were forced onto the surface.\nThey may have been driven there by volcanoes or earthquakes that shattered their subterranean homes, or perhaps by orcs or dragons. Finding no safe haven underground, they were forced above. Some may even have chosen to abandon their homes and give up the subterranean life.\nOver the centuries sundered dwarves adapted as best they could, but abandoning their natural habitat has taken its toll. They have lost much of their racial pride, and tend to be a miserable and dirty people. They have developed an irrational phobia of dark places, yet are uncomfortable under the open sky, in rain, and with most surface conditions.\nSundered dwarves are claustrophobic. A sundered dwarf must roll a successful saving throw vs. death in order to overcome his fear of the underground before he can enter dungeons, caves, and tombs. If the check fails, he may not enter. Once underground he must make a saving throw each day. If he fails, he will want to leave the underground by the most direct route. \nUnderground, a sundered dwarf attacks with a -2 penalty to his rolls. Should he fail his claustrophobic saving throw, the penalty increases by -1 for each additional day he stays underground. If he fails to reach open air, he may attempt further saving throws each day to overcome his claustrophobia. These saving throws are made at the same penalty as the dwarf\'s current attack roll penalty.\nSundered dwarves may be found living among other races. They may make up the majority of the inhabitants in a ghetto, or small groups of them may be found living or adventuring with other races.\nAlthough their traditional homes are gone, sundered dwarves continue to follow the crafts, especially mining and smithing. They will work for humans or elves.\nA typical sundered dwarf is slightly taller than a mountain dwarf, but he is of slimmer build. His skin is usually lighter than a hill dwarf\'s, more pink than brown. His hair is dark with tinges of blue. Stronger than other dwarves, they gain a +1 bonus to Strength in character generation.\nSundered dwarves are usually lawful neutral in alignment. Their society retains its traditional lawful organization, but is more concerned with maintaining its laws than ensuring that all citizens share in its benefits.}}'},

Those who judge by appearance see them as stunted and gnarled creatures and believe them to be the Rock Gnomes\' evil counterparts, the gnomish equivalent to the Drow and Duergar. In truth, they are no more evil than their more numerous cousins; their sinister reputation is merely the result of ignorance. The Deep Gnomes are the most reticent of all the gnomish subraces, surviving in an extremely hostile environment entirely by their own wiles.\nUnlike their Rock Gnome cousins, they have no friendly neighbors to ally themselves with, forcing them to become entirely selfreliant. Only the few who have won their trust know that they are in many ways as social and artistic as other gnomes.\nWhy do they endure this frankly hostile environment? The answer is simple: they are drawn by the lure of gemstones, which is more pronounced in the Svirfneblin than in\nany other subrace. The gem that most draws the interest and devotion of the Svirfneblin is the ruby, which is the predominant symbol of the race. The Deep Gnomes view these crimson stones with reverence approaching awe--so much so that they are never used for mundane practices such as ornamentation of garments, weapons, or armor. Rubies are reserved for sacred purposes and are often employed to decorate artifacts that are dedicated to the Svirfneblin gods. They are also favored by Deep Gnome monarchs, so much so that a Svirfneblin king or queen might have a full ring of rubies around his or her crown, with others of the precious stone set in the throne and sceptre.\nSvirfneblin make and wield *stun darts*, throwing them to a range of 40 feet, with a +2 bonus to hit. Each dart releases a small puff of gas when it strikes; any creature inhaling the gas must save versus poison or be stunned for 1 round and slowed for the four following rounds. Elite warriors (3rd-level and above) also often carry hollow darts with acid inside (+2d4 to damage) and *crystal caltrops* which, when stepped on, release a powerful sleep gas.}}'},

Their lives are geared toward the simple matter of survival in the woodlands, rather than enjoyment. Yet sylvan elves find that this life, more than anything else, gives them their greatest pleasure. Not for them the sophistication of art and delicate music. They prefer a simpler life. Their music is that of wind through leaves, the howl of wolves, and the cries of birds. Their art—in the form of tattoos—is inspired by the everchanging cycle of seasons.\nWood elves, by their very nature, seem more prone to violence than their civilized cousins. Their muscles are larger, their complexions more florid.\nSylvan elves are an independent folk and do not lightly brook intruders into their forests. Anyone, even another elf, who even draws near to a wood elf encampment (within three miles) will have a constant, unseen escort of at least two wood elves (possibly more) until the intruder leaves the area. Unless the camp is directly threatened, the wood elves will leave the intruder strictly alone. Twenty-five percent of the time wood elves will allow trespassers to know that they are being watched.\nIf those encroaching the encampment draw too near and evince hostile intent, the wood elves have no compunctions about utterly destroying them. Wood elves are extraordinarily reclusive—even more so than grey elves. They have no wish to let others expose them or their lifestyle to the harsh scrutiny of the civilized world. Therefore, they may even destroy those who bear the wood elves no particular ill will. They feel this is the only way to ensure their lives and privacy.\nAbove all, wood elves never try to leave their forests. They withdrew into the woods to escape the outer world, and whenever they leave they rediscover why they withdrew in the first place. Wood elves take a dim view of those who try to forcibly remove them. In general, wood elves are unfriendly and unhelpful. Any wood elf PC who is friendly to people he or she has just met (within the past five years or so) should be docked experience points for bad role-playing!\nFinally, wood elves have an aversion to most settings that are not of the woods. They hate the sea (although they can travel on lakes) and will not willingly board a seagoing ship. They hate the underground and become claustrophobic beneath the soil. These elves are even worse in the cities and lands of other races, including those of other elves. Sylvan elves regard cities as a perversion. They cannot deal with technology and civilization, for it was civilization that drove the wood elves into their isolation.}}'},

They make splendid carpenters (often building boats or wagons for human customers), as well as loggers, carvers, pipesmiths, musicians, shepherds, liverymen, dairymen, cheesemakers, hunters, and scouts. They are better farmers than Stouts (although not as good as Hairfeet) and more adept than any other subrace at harvesting natural bounties of berries, nuts, roots, and wild grains.\nThe only halflings who enjoy much proficiency at riding, Tallfellows favor small ponies. Indeed, many unique breeds of diminutive horse have been bred among Tallfellow clans: fast, shaggy-maned, nimble mounts with great endurance. In a charge, of course, they lack the impact of a human-mounted warhorse; nonetheless, Tallfellow companies have served admirably as light lancers and horsearchers during many a hardfought campaign.\nOn foot, Tallfellows wield spears with rare skill. They are adept at forming bristling `porcupine\' formations with these weapons, creating such a menacing array that horses and footmen alike are deterred from attacking.

However, whereas the other subraces seek gems, the Tinkers hold a different substance as the grandest rock of all: coal. The Tinkers hold that coal (also known as the "Father of Steam") is the most valuable substance of the world, and those places where it can be mined quickly become Tinker Gnome warrens.\nIn size and stature, the Tinkers resemble Rock Gnomes--so much so that the difference is not immediately apparent, at least when based only upon appearance.\nTinkers who live out their lives can attain an age of 250 or 300 years, but it must be noted that this is a rare occurrence among the members of this subrace. If one of his or her own inventions doesn\'t do a Tinker in, chances are good that one of his or her neighbor\'s gadgets will.\nEven in childhood, Tinkers are encouraged to experiment with gadgets and gimmicks, trying different means of making things to perform tasks that could otherwise be easily done by hand. The Tinker reaches adulthood at about the age of fifty (by which time perhaps 10-15% of them have already succumbed to the common fate of their kind). Despite this high attrition, it\'s not until maturity that a Tinker Gnome\'s activities begin to get really dangerous.\nUpon reaching adulthood, the Tinker Gnome must select a guild for himself or herself. The number of guilds available varies by location, but in Mount Nevermind on Krynn--which is the center of Tinker civilization and by far the largest community of these inventive creatures anywhere--there are more than 150 active guilds. These include virtually all areas of practical endeavor, and quite a few impractical ones as well.\nAfter selecting a guild, each member of the subrace settles upon a Life-quest. The actual choice of the quest may take several decades, but once it has been decided, it becomes the reason behind that Tinker\'s existence. The Lifequest is an attempt to reach a perfect understanding of some device (anything from a spelljamming helm to a screw), a task at which the Tinker very rarely succeeds. Indeed, the best estimate is that less than 1% of these gnomes ever do fully grasp the nature of the object that has occupied their attention for so much of their adult lives; the rest of these easily-distracted gnomes get hopelessly sidetracked somewhere along the way.\nDespite the vagaries of their existence, the Tinkers are a fun-loving and generally sociable race. Their speech is unique in both its speed and complexity. Two Tinkers can rattle off information and opinion to each other in a succession of thousand-word sentences, speaking simultaneously and yet listening and understanding (as much as is possible, given the esoteric nature of many discussions) each other even as they voice their own points of view. Those Tinkers who have had some experience interacting with other races have learned to slow the pace of their communication but never quite overcome their frustration with those who can\'t talk and listen at the same time.}}'},

The oak trees of dryads do not radiate magic, but someone finding a dryad\'s home has great power over her. A dryad suffers damage for any damage inflicted upon her home tree. Any attack on a dryad\'s tree will, of course, bring on a frenzied defense by the dryad.}}Specs=[Dryad,CreatureRace,0H,Creature]{{Section9=**Description**}}{{desc8=Dryads are beautiful, intelligent tree sprites. They are as elusive as they are alluring, however, and dryads are rarely seen unless taken by surprise - or they wish to be spotted.\nThe dryad\'s exquisite features, delicate and finely chiseled, are much like an elf maiden\'s. Dryads have high cheek bones and amber, violet, or dark green eyes. A dryad\'s complexion and hair color changes with the seasons, presenting the sprite with natural camouflage. During the fall, a dryad\'s hair turns golden or red, and her skin subtly darkens from its usual light tan to more closely match her hair color.\nThis enables her to blend with the falling leaves of autumn. In winter, both the dryad\'s hair and skin are white, like the snows that cover the oak groves. When encountered in a forest during fall or winter, a dryad is often mistaken for an attractive maid, probably of elvish descent. No one would mistake a dryad for an elf maid during the spring and summer, however. At these times of year, a dryad\'s skin is lightly tanned and her hair is green like the oak leaves around her.\nDryads often appear clothed in a loose, simple garment. The clothing they wear is the color of the oak grove in the season they appear.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Dryads are shy, nonviolent creatures. They rarely carry weapons, but they sometimes carry knives as tools. Though a dryad can use this as a weapon in a fight, she will not resort to using a knife unless seriously threatened.\nDryads have the ability to throw a powerful charm person spell three times a day (but only once per round). This spell is so powerful that targets of the spell suffer a -3 penalty to their saving throws. A Dryad always uses this spell if seriously threatened, attempting to gain control of the attacker who could help her most against his comrades. Dryads will only attempt to charm elves as a last resort because of their natural resistance to this type of spell.\nThe dryad\'s use of her ability to charm is not limited to combat situations, however. Whenever a dryad encounters a male with a Charisma of 16 or more, she usually tries to charm him. Charismatic victims of a dryad\'s attentions are taken to the tree sprite\'s home, where the men serve as amorous slaves to their beautiful captors. There is a 50% chance that a person charmed and taken away by a dryad will never\nreturn. If he does escape from the dryad\'s charms, it will be after 1d4 years of captivity.\nThis tree sprite also has two other powers that are very useful in defense. Unless surprised, a dryad has the ability to literally step through a tree and then dimension door to the oak tree she is part of. She can also speak with plants (as the 4th-level priest spell). This enables the dryad to gather information about parties traveling near her tree, and even to use vegetation to hinder potential attackers.}}'},

An earth elemental can travel through solid ground or stone with no penalty to movement or dexterity.

For example, a reinforced door, which might require a few rounds to shatter using conventional methods, can be smashed with ease by an earth elemental. They can even level a small cottage in a few rounds.\nAn earth elemental\'s effectiveness against creatures in the air or water is limited; the damage done by the elemental\'s fists on airborne or waterborne targets is lessened by 2 points per die (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die).}}'},

In fact the "clothing" is their own saggy skin and pointed heads. The limbs are knottily muscled. The fingernails and toenails are thick and filthy, although the fingers and toes are very nimble. Their gray-brown, warty hide blends in with natural earth and stone. When they wear rags or scraps as clothing, such items are also camouflage colored.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Jermlaine are cowards who have made an art of the ambush. They only attack when they feel there is no serious opposition. They prefer to attack injured, ill, or sleeping victims. They avoid directly confronting strong, alert parties, although they may try to injure them out of sheer maliciousness.\nThe jermlaines\' favorite tactic is capturing victims with nets or pits. In little-used passages the creatures prepare pits covered by camouflaged doors or string nets overhead. In more-traveled passages, the jermlaine stretch trip cords. When a victim falls afoul of a trap, the jermlaine swarm over him. Some pummel him with blackjacks while others tie him with ropes and cords. Such beatings have a cumulative 2% chance per blow of causing the victim to lapse into unconsciousness. If a victim is wearing splint, banded, or plate mail, these pummeling attacks are ineffective.

Should the kobolds be reduced to only a three to two ratio in their favor, they must make a morale check. Kobolds are wary of spellcasters and will aim for them when possible.\nThis diminutive race also enjoys setting up concealed pits with spikes, crossbows, and other mechanical traps. They usually have view ports and murder holes near these traps so that they can pour flaming oil, missile weapons, or drop poisonous insects on their victims.\nKobold war bands are armed with spiked clubs, axes, javelins, short swords and spears.

In combat, there is only a 10% chance that a typical ogrillon can be distinguished from an orc. Ogrillons that resemble ogres, of course, clearly stand out.

Orcs have a slightly stooped posture, a low jutting forehead, and a snout instead of a nose, though comparisons between this facial feature and those of pigs are exaggerated and perhaps unfair. Orcs have well-developed canine teeth for eating meat and short pointed ears that resemble those of a wolf. Orcish snouts and ears have a slightly pink tinge. Their eyes are human, with a reddish tint that sometimes makes them appear to glow red when they reflect dim light sources in near darkness. This is actually part of their optical system, a pigment which gives them infravision.}}{{desc1=**Combat:** Orcs are constantly in battle.

They are highly organized and greatly enjoy raiding shore communities for food and sport. Typical sahuagins are blackish green on their backs, shading to green on their bellies, with black fins. Their great, staring eyes are deep, shining black. They have scaly skin, with webbed fingers and toes, and their mouths are filled with sharp fangs. About 1 in 216 sahuagin is a mutation with four usable arms. These specimens are usually black shading to gray. Females are indistinguishable from males, except that they are slightly smaller. Hatchlings are a light green color, but they darken and attain full growth approximately one to two months after hatching.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** See attacks above - equip weapons as needed. Spears are used only as thrusting weapons. Nets are set with dozens of hooks that make escape virtually impossible for unarmored victims or creatures not able to grasp and tear with a Strength of 16 or greater. Nets are replaced by three javelins when the band forays onto land. The crossbows fire a maximum of 30 feet underwater and normal ranges on the surface. Tridents have three uses -- to spear small prey, to pin prey trapped in nets, and to hold threatening opponents at bay.\nWhen raiding villages, sahuagin attack en masse, with leaders in the second rank. As long as there is no truly spirited resistance, they continue in their plunder and violence. Underwater, in their natural element, the sahuagin are far more confident. Using the three-dimensional aspect of underwater fighting, they sometimes dive down on a group of underwater explorers, coming in from behind, and swooping down and past them, dropping nets on their intended victims.\nWhen sahuagin attack ships, they swarm up from all sides and try to overwhelm with numbers. They often grab their opponents and hurl them into the sea, where at least a fourth of the raiding party lurks, waiting for such an action or as reinforcements. Some leaders carry a conch shell, which when sounded gives the signal for the group of sahuagin in reserve to enter the fray. \nSahuagin have an almost paralyzing fear of spellcasters. They direct their strongest attacks toward anyone who uses spells or spell-like powers, such as the functions of some magical items.}}'},

Unlike other undead creatures, the vampire can easily pass among normal men without drawing attention to itself for, although its facial features are sharp and feral, they do not seem inhuman. In many cases, a vampire\'s true nature is revealed only when it attacks. There are ways in which a vampire may be detected by the careful observer, however. Vampires cast no reflection in a glass, cast no shadows, and move in complete silence.}}'},

The elemental\'s arms appear as smaller waves, one thrust out on each side of its main body. The arms ebb and flow, growing longer or shorter as the elemental moves. Two orbs of deep green peer out of the front of the wave and serve the elemental as eyes}}{{desc1=In combat, the water elemental is a dangerous adversary. It prefers to fight in a large body of water where it can constantly disappear beneath the waves and suddenly swell up behind its opponent.\nWhen the elemental strikes, it lashes out with a huge wave-like arm, doing 5-30 points of damage. Water elementals are also a serious threat to ships that cross their paths. A water elemental can easily overturn small craft (one ton of ship per hit die of the elemental) and stop or slow almost any vessel (one ton of ship per hit point of the elemental). Ships not completely stopped by an elemental will be slowed by a percentage equal to the ratio of ship\'s tons over the hit points of the attacking elemental.\nThough the water elemental is most effective in large areas of open water, it can be called upon to serve in a battle on dry land, close to the body of water from which it arose. However, the movement of the water elemental on land is the most restricted of any elemental type: a water elemental cannot move more than 60 yards away from the water it was conjured from, and 1 point of damage is subtracted from each die of damage they inflict out of the water (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die)}}'},

The staff then fights on its own at the same level of experience as its wielder. After four rounds of dancing, the staff returns to its wielder, who must hold it (and use it) for four rounds before it can dance again. When dancing, the staff will leave its owner\'s hand and may go up to [[30]] feet distant. At the end of its fourth round of solo combat, it will move to its possessor\'s hand automatically. Note that when dancing the staff cannot be physically hit, although certain magical attacks such as a fireball, lightning bolt, or transmute metal to wood spell could affect it.\nFinally, remember that the dancing staff fights alone exactly the same; if a 7th-level thief is the wielder, the staff will so fight when dancing. Relieved of his weapon for four melee rounds, the possessor may act in virtually any manner desired—resting, discharging missiles, drawing another weapon and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, etc.—as long as he remains within [[30]] feet of the staff.

Magically held or locked portals can be opened in this manner. Structural damage from the ramlike force is identical to an actual battering ram, with double or triple damage accruing for applications of two or three charges. Magical items struck by the ramlike force must save versus crushing blow if three charges are used; otherwise, the force will not affect them. Nonmagical items which are the target of the force save versus crushing blow from the impact.\nA ring of this sort will have from 6 to 10 charges when discovered.

If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it less likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled. A dispel magic spell does not affect a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature\'s saving throw against this effect; otherwise, it is automatically rendered nonoperational. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed. Note that an item\'s physical properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.\nArtifacts and relics are not subject to this spell; however, some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DM\'s option.\nNote that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions.}}'},

The mouth cannot speak magical spells or use command words.

Of course, the magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms.\nThe spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the command of the spellcaster.

Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: "Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot." Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th-level wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30 yards ("Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards."). The spell lasts until the speak command can be fulfilled; thus, the spell duration is variable.

The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Note that a natural (unmodified) roll of 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of saving throw penalties. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does.

The climate is comfortable for all creatures involved, so that protection from the elements is not necessary.\nActivation of the rod causes the wielder and as many creatures as were touched with the item at the time of use to be transported instantaneously to the paradise.

This power, which can be employed only by a druid, is activated when one end of the staff is touched to a heavy object of roughly spherical shape (a stone, metal ball, pottery crock, etc.) of up to nine inches in diameter and five pounds in weight. The object adheres to the end of the staff, and the wielder need then only swing the staff in an overhand arc to release the missile toward a desired target.\nThe missile leaves the staff on the downstroke of the overhand swing and travels in a low, rising trajectory, with the missile going one foot upward for every 10 feet traveled. Of course, the arc may be higher, or the missile aimed so as to travel nearly vertically. (In the latter case, reverse the arcing ratio so that one foot of distance laterally is covered for every 10 feet of vertical rise.) The maximum range of such a missile is 180 feet, with limits of 60 feet and 120 feet on short and medium range, respectively.\nThis staff also carries charges, and a druid wielding the item can expend one charge and thereby use the staff to hurl a missile of large size, as if the wielder were a stone giant (range out to 300 feet, 3d10 points of damage per hit). Whether used as a magical quarterstaff or by employing one of its slinging powers, the staff bestows +1 to the wielder\'s attack roll and +1 per die to damage dealt out.

It has the properties of a +2 magical weapon without any expenditure of its magical charges. Its other magical properties are as follows:\n**Thunder:** Take in hand and attack with *Thunder*. The staff strikes as a +3 weapon, and unless the opponent struck saves successfully vs. rods, staves, and wands, he will be stunned from the noise of the staff\'s impact—unable to take any further action in the round struck, and automatically having last initiative in the following round. This power requires the expenditure of one charge.\n**Lightning:** Take in hand and attack with *Lightning*. A short spark of electricity leaps forth when the opponent is struck, causing normal staff damage, plus 2d6 additional points of damage from shock. Note that the staff might not score a hit, but the electrical discharge discounts any form of metal armor (making the target effectively AC 10 for this purpose), so only such damage might apply. This power requires the expenditure of one charge.\n[**Thunderclap:**](!magic --display-ability @{selected|token_id}|Powers-DB|Thunderclap --mi-charges @{selected|token_id}|-2|Staff-of-Thunder+Lightning) The staff sends forth a cone of deafening noise, 5 feet wide at the apex, 40 feet long, and 20 feet wide at a point farthest from the source. All creatures within this cone, wholly or partially, must roll a successful saving throw vs. rods, staves, and wands or be stunned for 1d2 rounds (unable to attack during this time) and unable to hear for 1d2 additional rounds. Those who save are unable to hear for 1d4 rounds, but suffer no loss of attacks. This function requires the expenditure of two charges.\n[**Lightning Stroke:**](!magic --display-ability @{selected|token_id}|Powers-DB|Lightning-Stroke} --mi-charges @{selected|token_id}|-2|Staff-of-Thunder+Lightning) A bolt similar to that from a wand of lightning is generated, but it is of 8d6 strength, causing 16-48 points of damage (rolls of 1 are counted as 2) to those who fail a saving throw.

This function of the rod uses two charges.\n[**Thunder \\amp Lightning:**](!magic --display-ability @{selected|token_id}|Powers-DB|Thunder+Lightning} --mi-charges @{selected|token_id}|-4|Staff-of-Thunder+Lightning) This power combines the thunderclap, described above, with a forked lightning bolt as in the lightning stroke. Damage from the lightning is a total of 8d6 with rolls of 1 or 2 counted as rolls of 3, for a range of 24-48 points. A saving throw applies, with deafness and half damage suffered by those who are successful. This power requires the expenditure of four charges.\nThe casting time required for any function is equal to the number of charges expended; thus, the thunder \\amp lightning function costs four charges and has an initiative modifier of +4.}}'},

It can be used to *absorb* wizard spell energy directed at its wielder, but if the staff absorbs energy beyond its charge limit, it will explode as if a "retributive strike" (see below) had been made. The spell levels of energy absorbed count only as recharging the staff, but they cannot be redirected immediately, so if absorption is desired, that is the only action possible by the staff wielder that round. Note also that the wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at him, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. Absorbing spells is risky, but absorption is the only way this staff can be recharged.\nRetributive strike is a breaking of the staff. It must be purposeful and declared by the wizard wielding it. When this is done all levels of spell energy in the staff are released in a globe of 30-foot radius. All creatures within 10 feet of the broken staff suffer hit points of damage equal to eight times the number of spell levels of energy in the rod (1 to 25), those between 10 feet to 20 feet take 6 x levels, and those 20 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 x levels.

Either effect causes a 50% change in size.\nRelative Strength and power increases or decreases proportionally, providing the weaponry employed is proportionate or usable. For humanoid creatures enlarged, Strength is roughly proportional to that of a giant of corresponding size. For example, a humanoid enlarged to 9 feet tall is roughly equivalent to a hill giant (19 strength), and a 13-foot tall humanoid equals a fire giant (22 Strength).\nThe wand\'s power has a range of 10 feet. The target creature and all it is wearing or carrying are affected unless a saving throw succeeds. Note that a willing target need not to make a saving throw.\nThe effect of the wand can be removed by a dispel magic spell, but if this is done, the target must roll a system shock check. It can also be countered if the possessor of the wand wills the effect to be canceled before the duration of the effect expires. Each usage of the wand (but not the cancellation of an effect) expends one charge. It can be recharged by a wizard of 12th or higher level.}}{{materials=Wand}}{{Use=Take the wand in-hand using the *Change Weapon* dialogue in order to use its powers with the *Attack* action}}'},

If for any reason the gem is not kept beyond the three-month period, the additional Intelligence remains, but the additional Wisdom is lost. A *gem of insight* functions once every 50 years.

They save as if they were of hard metal—+[[3]] bonus.\nThis Red Ioun stone is able to cast *Fear* once per day, as per the 4th level Wizard spell. When a fear spell is cast, the wizard sends forth an invisible cone of terror that causes creatures within its area of effect to turn away from the caster and flee in panic. Affected creatures are likely to drop whatever they are holding when struck by the spell; the base\nchance of this is 60% at 1st level (or at 1 Hit Die), and each level (or Hit Die) above this reduces the probability by 5%. Thus, at 10th level there is only a 15% chance, and at 13th\nlevel no chance, of dropping items. Creatures affected by fear flee at their fastest rate for a number of melee rounds equal to the level of experience of the user. Undead and creatures that successfully roll their saving throws vs. spell are not affected.}}{{materials=The Ioun stone}}'},

The amulet does not give the new form\'s other abilities (attack, magic, special movement, etc.), nor does it run the risk of the user changing personality and mentality.\nWhen the polymorph occurs, the user\'s equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The user retains all mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. A user not used to a new form might be penalised at the DM\'s option (for example, -2 penalty to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.\nThus, a user changed into an owl could fly, but his vision would be human; a change to a black pudding would enable movement under doors or along halls and ceilings, but not the pudding\'s offensive (acid) or defensive capabilities.

It has a physical lock. There are several Tomes of Math Mathonwy known to exist. Each is a Tome containing 2+1d4 tested and experimental rites and rituals, some of which might work but many of which are disastrous to attempt - there are also always an additional 4+1d8 blank pages. The Tome can only hold and retain rituals to cast MU spells with Casting Times of 2 or more Rounds - though often the rituals will take Turns to perform. If spells of shorter casting times are written into the Tome, they are absorbed into the page and disappear. Each Tome is fireproof (but only gains a save at +4 vs. magical fire) and proof against Dispel Magic, Disintegration and similar magical destruction (other than magical fire). They all have some type of lock on them, most often a magical lock such as a Glyph of Warding but sometimes just a physical lock.\nWizards of any level can use the Tome, and even attempt to perform any of the Rituals therein. Tried and tested Rituals (i.e. to cast defined spells as from the PHB, the Complete Wizard\'s Handbook or the Tome of Magic) can be cast from the Tome with a success rate never greater than 90% minus 5% for each level between the casting MU and the level required to cast the spell. Success means the ritual has the described effect: failure has a chance of summoning an avatar of Math Mathonwy (see AD\\ampD Legends \\amp Lore - Celtic Mythos for details of the avatar), 20% plus 5% per level of the Ritual being performed. The avatar will endeavour to recover the Tome and return immediately to the plane of the Celtic Gods.\nExperimental rituals (researched and devised by the Wizard as per DMG, or by the DM) will have chances of success or failure as determined by the DM and appropriate to the ritual concerned. Failure may incur additional penalties but will always have a chance of an avatar of Math Mathonwy appearing to be determined based on an equivalent level of the ritual as determined by the DM.\nWizards cannot transfer rituals from the Tome into their spell books - for some reason they never seem to transcribe correctly. However, Wizards of any level do not have to do any other check to use the rituals other than described above.}}{{materials=Book}}'},

Otherwise, the color determines the damage inflicted and its special power. The caster can create a single orb of any color listed for his level or lower.\n***Light:*** the victim is surrounded by light to a radius of 20 feet, as if affected by a light spell.

							+'<br>'
							+'<h3>Improved Initiative multi-tasking</h3>'
							+'<p>When using "Group" or "Individual" initiative types, and multiple players and the GM are all in the process of specifying what they are going to do in the next round to set the correct Turn Order priorities, the system now responds much more quickly to the user\'s button selection, returning a "Please Wait" message when necessary, and pushing back non-critical processing until after players have completed action selection. This means that Turn Order entries for each character / NPC / Creature may be delayed for a few seconds after the final button press occurs.</p>'
							+'<h3>Turn tracker rotation on/off</h3>'
							+'<p>A new command has been added to RoundMaster v4.043 to stop and start the rotation of the arrow circle around the token that is at the top of the Turn Tracker. The command <b>!rounds --rotatetracker [ON/OFF]</b> takes one optional parameter of \'on\' or \'off\'. If no parameter is specified, rotation is toggled between the two possible states.  This command has been provided after performance issues were found with the rotating graphics on some computers.</p>'
							+'<h3>"Looks Like" template tag</h3>'
							+'<p>A new field tag <b>{{Looks Like=...}}</b> has been added for the RPGMaster templates <i>RPGMspell</i> and <i>RPGMdefault</i>, and all templates based on these (i.e. all tempates except <i>RPGMmessage</i> and <i>RPGMattack</i> templates). This field can be used to describe what a magic item looks like when it is first found. If the item is <i>hidden</i> as a different item using the GM\'s <i>Add Items</i> dialog and the template includes a "Looks Like" field tag with text, only the text in the Looks Like field will be shown to the player when viewed or used, up until the hidden item is revealed.  The GM will always see the full item description whenever the GM views or uses an item, hidden or not.</p>'
							+'<h3>Auto-hiding of items</h3>'
							+'<p>A configuration flag can now be set by the GM using the <b>!magic --config</b> or <b>!attk --config</b> commands for "Auto-hiding Items". When set, and the GM adds an item to an container using the GM\'s <i>Add Items</i> dialog, and that item has a "Looks Like" field tag defined with text describing what the item looks like when first found (see previous note), the item will automatically be hidden as an item reflecting its generic item type (or supertype), or whatever has been set as its type using the "st:" data tag in the item definition. The GM can then specify when its true nature will be revealed (on viewing, on use, or manually by GM) using the other functions on the <i>Add Items</i> dialog.</p>'
							+'<h3>GM easy manual reveal for hidden items</h3>'
							+'<p>When a player character uses a hidden item, the GM is already passed a message in the Chat Window saying which item has been used, with a button to display the details of the item. If the item being used is actually a hidden item, when the GM displays the item description a button will appear for the GM to manually reveal the hidden item, if they so desire. This saves the GM having to use the <i>Add Items</i> dialog to manually reveal items.</p>'
							+'<h3>Default item class to "Miscellaneous"</h3>'
							+'<p>If the GM created new magic items in their own database, the class was restricted to those defined in the <i>Spells & Magic Items Database Help</i> handout. It is now possible to invent totally new item classes - all item classes not defined in the APIs will now default to working the same way as the "Miscelaneous" item class - that is they will appear in Miscellaneous menu lists, and can be used by any character class or creature that is defined in the databases as being able to use magic items.</p>'
							+'<h3>Alphabeticised item lists</h3>'
							+'<p>By default, all lists of magic items given on the GM\'s <i>Add Items</i> dialog and on the Player\'s <i>Edit Weapons & Armour</i> and <i>Edit Magic Items</i> dialogs are now alphabeticised. Select the letter from the first drop down to see a list of all items starting with that letter in a second drop down. The alphabetical lists can be returned to just show all items in one big list by using the <b>!magic --config</b> or <b>!attk --config</b> dialog, or for the GM using the "alpha true/false" button at the top of the <i>Add Items</i> dialog.</p>'
							+'<h3>AC Item combination rule data</h3>'
							+'<p>Data tags to specify which other types of AC item any particular item can be used in combination with, or not, can now be specified in the ACData section of an item definition using the <b>rules:</b> data tag. After the tag:</p>'
							+'<ul><li>preceeding an item <i>type, supertype,</i> or <i>name</i> with \'-\' means this item cannot combine with that type of item</li>'
							+'<li>preceeding an item <i>type, supertype,</i> or <i>name</i> with \'+\' means it can always be used with it</li>'
							+'<li>an item with \'-acall\' will not combine with any other AC items except those with a \'+\'</li>'
							+'<li>an item with \'-magic\' will not combine with any magical armour</li>'
							+'<li>an item with \'-shield\' will not combine with any form of shield</li></ul>'
							+'<p>See the <i>Weapons & Armour Database Help</i> handout for more information and examples.</p>'
							+'<h3>Improved Check AC dialog</h3>'
							+'<p>The Check AC dialog now explains the effect on AC of each item, even if the magical bonus or penalty is not displayed as part of the item name.</p>'
							+'<h3>Tidying Character Sheets</h3>'
							+'<p>Improved the function that examines Character Sheets in a campaign and removes any spurious objects created by the RPGMaster APIs so as to speed up processing.</p>'
							+'<h3>Custom Items database</h3>'
							+'<p>All custom magic items, ones that do not appear in any of the AD&D2e manuals, have been split out of the current databases and stored in a new database <i>MI-DB-Custom</i>. These can be viewed by extracting the custom item database using the <b>!magic --extract-db MI-DB-Custom</b> command. However, in this release all custom items are indistinguishable from other items in the campaign. A future release will include a configuration flag to exclude or include the custom database from use. All GM-created databases will be unaffected.</p>'
							+'<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>'
							+'<p>A number of bug fixes have been applied, including: fixed handing an undefined Race character sheet field; fixed magic helm ac modifiers; fixed --mod-weap selection using a named item; fixed GM display of a spell or a used item to whisper to the GM only rather than display to all players.</p>'
							+'<h2>Release v1.4.07</h2>'
							+'<h3>Spells as Powers in <i>Powerful</i> items</h3>'
							+'<p>It has been possible to store Spells as Powers for a character (via the <i>Token Setup / Add to Spellbook</i> dialogue) for a little while. It is now also possible to do this for items that can store powers. The GM can add powers to any item that has an API button that calls the command <code>!magic --cast-spell MI-POWERS|@{selected|token_id}</code> using the <i>Add Item / Store Spells/Powers in MI</i> button, and the dialogue presented will now allow spells (both Wizard & Priest) to be stored as powers in the item to be cast at a specified level and a specified number of times per day by the character, recharging after a long rest. Note that in order to implement this, if powerful items like this are stored, picked up, or transfered to another character using <i>MI menu / Search</i> or <i>MI menu / Store</i> the powers will be restored to full charges as if a long rest had occurred (I\'ve used the field that passed the current charges left to transfer the level of casting instead).</p>'
							+'<h3>Arced Areas of Effect</h3>'
							+'<p>It is now possible to specify areas of effect that are arcs of 90 or 180 degrees. Just use the \'ARC90\' or \'ARC180\' area definition when calling the <code>!rounds --aoe</code> command.</p>'
							+'<h3><i>Drag & Drop</i> Creatures for Bags of Tricks</h3>'
							+'<p>I have added <i>Drag & Drop</i> creature definitions for all the creatures that can be summoned by all three types of the standard Bags of Tricks defined in the DMG (all of which are non-magical mammals). When a character uses a Bag of Tricks, a dice can be rolled to determine which creature appears of those that are possible for that type of bag, and the GM can then create a new character sheet in the Journal, give it an appropriate avatar image from their loaded art, and <i>Drag & Drop</i> the creature onto the map, using the presented dialogue to choose the appropriate creature.</p>'
							+'<h3>Macro-accessible Item Quantity</h3>'
							+'<p>The character sheet now has an attribute which holds the current number of charges left of the currently selected magic item, held in the attribute MIct|max. To see an example of how this is used, see the definition for the <i>Boots-Winged</i> item in the MI-DB database (and the associated <i>Boots-of-Flying-turn</i> effect in the Effects-DB database) which can fly for 120 minutes per day but which can be in several sessions. This sets a status round counter to the value of MIct|max, then counts down from this deducting 1 charge per round. If the character stops flying, the GM ends the status and the charges stop deducting. If there are charges left, the character can fly again for up to that duration. The charges then recharge over a long rest (rather than 24 hours, which it should be).<p>'
							+'<h3>New Effect ^^Duration^^ attribute tag</h3>'
							+'<p>In support of the Macro-accessible Item Quantity introduced above, the Effect attribute tag ^^Duration^^ has also been added.  ^^Duration^^ specified as a tag in a "-turn" Effect macro will resolve to the number of rounds that have passed since the last "-turn" call, which is normally 1 round. However, if the GM uses the Maintenance Menu to set a new Round number in the Turn Tracker, ^^Duration^^ in any running Effect will resolve to the number of rounds that have passed (the difference between the previous and new round numbers, positive only). This allows the "-turn" Effect to, for instance in the Winged Boots example used above, reduce the remaining charges of the boots by the number of rounds passed. This allows the GM to skip over the rounds it takes for the character using the boots to fly somewhere, without having to go through each round individually (which would be boring for everyone).</p>'
							+'<p>For Effect types "-start", "-end", "-add", "-dancing", "-inhand", and "-sheath", ^^Duration^^ always resolves to zero.</p>'
							+'<h3>Non-divisable Charged & Uncharged items</h3>'
							+'<p>Items that are Recharging, Rechargeable, Absorbing etc are always picked up or stored as a complete, singular item with all their charges intact which cannot be divided. However, Charged and Uncharged items (and Cursed, which is equivalent to Uncharged) with more than one charge present a menu on Searching or Storing allowing the character to pick or put one, all, or a specified number of the "charges" - which assumes the item can logically be divided. This is deemed sensible for potions and scrolls but, for instance, for a non-rechargeable wand with several charges it would be impossible to "snap the wand in two" and pick up or store only some of the charges, leaving the rest behind. So I\'ve added two new types of item: <i>"Discharging"</i> (which is a non-divisable Charged item) and <i>"Cursed-Uncharged"</i> (an Uncharged item that is Cursed such that it cannot be divided or is otherwise not sensible to divide). It is also the case that only divisable items (i.e. Charged, Uncharged & Cursed - but not Cursed-Uncharged) can stack in the character\'s item bag, as others will not be able to be un-stacked as they are not divisable. Uncharged items (such as weapons, ammo and armour) and Charged items (such as potions and scrolls) remain both divisable and stackable.</p>'
							+'<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>'
							+'<p>A number of bug fixes have been applied, including the fix to the <i>Token Setup / Add to Spellbook</i> button that will now work.</p>'
							+'<h2>Release v1.4.05</h2>'
							+'<h3>Magic Item Bags</h3>'
							+'<p>Some magic items are in fact bags that hold other magic items: e.g. a Bag of Holding, or a Bag of Beans. An item specification can now be written to automatically create a "magic item character sheet" which can hold other items, and even be specified with a starting set of items such as the beans in the bag. The character sheet so created will be controlled by and in the journal of the character that has the magic item bag, and if looted or given away, the ownership moves with it (requires the new owner to <i>view</i> or <i>use</i> the magic item bag first.  See the Magic Database Help handout for more details.</p>'
							+'<h3>DM Info in Roll Templates</h3>'
							+'<p>Any Roll Template based on any RPGM template (except RPGMattack and RPGMmessage) can now have a line tag of "GM Info=" included, the contents of which will only be displayed if the GM is one of the recipients for the message: e.g. {{GM Info=This will be displayed if the GM is one of the recipients of this Roll Template message}}. This can be useful to include information you only want the GM to see, for instance about how to play a spell or how to tailor a magic item.</p>'
							+'<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>'
							+'<p>Fixes to issues with manual updates to saving throws, changing the rings on each hand using the <i>Change Weapon</i> dialogue and searching, looting and storing items and equipment.</p>'

							+'<p>The RPGMaster Library API provides the data and rule-set processing for a specific RPG version and Roll20 Character Sheet for the RPGMaster series of APIs.

							+'<p>The functions and data in the Library cannot be accessed directly by the GM or Players (with the exception of the RPGMaster Roll Templates). It does not support any API commands directly, but supports the functioning of the API commands provided by other RPGMaster APIs: <b>InitiativeMaster, AttackMaster, MagicMaster</b> and <b>CommandMaster</b>, to the extent that these APIs will not function without the Library being loaded. <b>Note:</b> RoundMaster does not have any RPG-version specific aspects, is independent of the Library, and does not require a RPGMaster Library to be loaded to function.</p>'
							+'<p>The Library does Roll Template processing for RPGMaster-defined Roll Templates. These can be used by GMs to create their own Chat menus and displays.  See the descriptions in Section 2 for how to access and use these templates.</p>'
							+'<p>The Library also provides a number of objects and functions that can be called from other APIs. These include an extensive Character Sheet table management suite described in Section 3 below, for table structures defined by The Aaron in various standard Roll20 Character Sheets, such as the Advanced D&D 2e character sheet by Peter B. There are a number of other useful functions, which are described in Section 3.</p>'

							+'<p>Roll Templates are standard Roll20 functionality, often provided by various Character Sheet versions. The RPGMaster Library provides RPGMaster-specific versions of Roll Templates to support gameplay using the RPGMaster series of APIs. Of course, they can also be used for other purposes by the GM to support their design for gameplay, and by other APIs that might be loaded alongside the RPGMaster Library API. The list of those provided is:</p>'

							+'</table>'
							+'<p>The templates are built upon four base templates: <i>RPGMattack, RPGMspell, RPGMmessage,</i> and <i>RPGMdefault</i>. However, each individual template can have different colour swatches and background images. It is also possible for the GM to use special template field tags to change the colours and background images of various parts of the templates, as described below.</p>'
							+'<h3>2.1 User-Selectable Template Display Options</h3>'
							+'<p>In the API configuration menu, opened using <b>!attk --config</b> or <b>!magic --config</b>, the GM can choose whether the default display of RPGMaster Roll Templates for everyone is <i>Fancy</i>, meaning the system uses background textures and images to make the chat templates look interesting, or <i>Plain</i>, which means the default display is of coloured templates but without textures or images.</p>'
							+'<p>In addition, each Player can choose their own options: at the top right of every menu or message displayed in the chat using a RPGMaster Template is a cog wheel. Clicking this cog wheel will display an options dialog for the Player with three options - Menus with Images, Plain Menus, and Dark Mode Menus. The Player can select one of the options, and the current and all future menus and messages using RPGMaster Roll Templates will be displayed for that particular Player using this new option. The option persists for that Player between gameplay sessions.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> if use of a template includes any of the colour or image field tags (<i>outer image, title image</i> or <i>body image</i>) these images will always appear regardless of which option the Player chooses. The field tags always override the original template definition.</p>'
							+'<h3>2.2 Colour, Padding and Image Override Field Tags</h3>'
							+'<p>All RPGMaster templates can use the following field tags (with some exceptions as noted). The field tags are used in this way:</p>'
							+'<pre>{{field tag=... whatever you want to be in this field ...}}</pre>'
							+'<p>However, the fields in this table do not display data, but take the content of the field after the "=" as data for a CSS command to change the behavior of the template.</p>'

							+'<pre>LibRPGMaster.function( parameters )</pre>'
							+'<p>Alternatively, so as not to need to reference the Library, and/or to facilitate an easily alterable and maintainable reference that can be changed in one place, the Library reference can be made within a function mapping, like this:</p>'

							+'<p>Some data on Character Sheets is best represented in tables, made up of multiple rows of multiple fields. Some tables can also have multiple columns of rows, each column containing rows which in turn have multiple fields (in fact, each column is considered a table in itself). Having a structured set of functions to add to, find, read, update, and remove data in these tables is a useful function to have. the <b>ChatSetAttr API</b> from The Aaron provides an amount of such functionality, but the RPGMaster Library provides a full suite of management functions, based on the definition of a standard Table Object, with associated Methods. The mechanics of the Character Sheet table are then hidden from the author of the API, who can concentrate on other functionality.</p>'
							+'<p>The Library consists of the Table Object, and the Methods. The mechanics of the Table Object are hidden from the API (but can be exposed & used if you know what you are doing and understand the structure of Character Sheet tables fully).

See the database help handouts distributed with the RPGMaster APIs for more information on each type of database.</p>'

							+'<pre>DBindex = getDBindex( <i>forceUpdate</i> )</pre>'
							+'<p>A function to build or get and return an index to all entries in the RPGMaster databases. This function <b><i>must</i></b> be called before any items in the databases are queried or acted upon with the other database management functions. Having this index (which is globally held in the system) speeds up database access considerably over relying on the Roll20 object management functions, and allows the APIs to seamlessly access items that might be in either internal object databases or held in external character sheet databases, and supports the prioritisation of user-defined database items over Library defined items. Takes one optional parameter:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+	'<li><b><i>forceUpdate:</i></b> (optional) A boolean flag: if true, forces the global database index to be recreated from scratch. If false or not provided, only builds the index if it does not already exist (e.g. when the game session has just started and the APIs initialise)</li>'
							+'</ul><br>'
							+'<pre>dbItemObject = abilityLookup( rootDB, dbItemName, <i>character, silent, default</i> );</pre>'
							+'<p>A function to get an entry from a database. Uses the global DBindex internally to access the correct database entry directly, eliminating the speed of a Roll20 object search. The building of the index using getDBindex() will determine the priority order of the potential sources for database items: see that function description for details. However, if the item does not have an entry in the DBindex (i.e. is not in any currently loaded database), and if a character sheet object is passed as a parameter, this abilityLookup() function will also search the character sheet for a copy of the database item which might have previously been placed there by a getAbility() function call. This allows characters to have items that come from user-defined databases in one campaign that are carried with them to other campaigns which perhaps don\'t have the same user-defined databases loaded.</p>'
							+'<p>Takes the following parameters:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+	'<li><b>rootDB:</b> The root database name for the type of item being recovered. Will access indexes from any database name that starts with the rootDB name. Can be one of <i>MU-Spells-DB, PR-Spells-DB, Powers-DB, MI-DB, Attacks-DB, Class-DB</i></li>'
							+	'<li><b>dbItemName:</b> The name of the item being searched for. The following characters are ignored: \'-\', \'_\', \'space\'.</li>'
							+	'<li><b><i>character:</i></b> (optional) the character sheet object for the character sheet for which the item is relevant, and which might hold any orphaned item that is not available in current databases.</li>'
							+	'<li><b><i>silent:</i></b> (optional) a boolean value which, if true, will surpress any error message if the rootDB is invalid or the item cannot be found. False or not provided will result in error messages being returned.</li>'
							+	'<li><b><i>default:</i></b> (optional) a boolean value which, if false, returns < undefined > for any database item object if the item is not found or other errors occur, or if true or not defined returns a default item with the following structure:<br>'
							+		'<pre>{name:\'-\',type:\'\',ct:\'0\',charge:\'uncharged\',cost:\'0\',body:\'This is a blank slot. Go search out something new to fill it up!\'}</pre></li>'

							+'<br>'
							+'<pre>itemObject = setAbility( character, itemName, itemBody, <i>actionBar</i> )</pre>'
							+'<p>A function to set or update a database item or an ability macro in a character sheet (database items are stored as ability macros on a character sheet). <b>Note:</b> the API in-memory databases cannot be updated in this way.

							+'<h2>Character Sheet and Token setup for use with RPGMaster APIs</h2>'
							+'<h3>1. Using APIs to do setup</h3>'
							+'<p>The simplest way to configure a Character Sheet for use with the RPGMaster APIs is to use the functions of the APIs to set up the Character Sheet. If the <b>CommandMaster API</b> is installed, a number of features and commands are provided to help the DM/Game Creator in this process.</p>'
							+'<p>The most basic of these is to configure a blank Character Sheet.</p>'
							+'<ul><li>Use the [+Add] button on the Roll20 Journal to add a new blank Character Sheet, and Roll20 displays a form to give the sheet a name (or accept with the default provided by Roll20) and optionally an image.</li>'
							+'<li>Select the [Save Changes] button on this form, and then close the blank Character Sheet.</li>'
							+'<li>Drag the newly created Character Sheet onto the map area of the Roll20 UI.</li>'
							+'<li>Switch to the Chat Window, and the <i>Review & Set Race & Classes</i> menu has appeared (scroll down to the bottom if need be).</li>'
							+'<li>If this menu has not appeared, the menu can be opened on the DM\'s Token-Setup button.</li>'
							+'<li>Make sure the token you have just placed on the map area is selected (often it is not).</li>'
							+'<li>Selecting a Creature type from the Creature drop-down list will automatically setup the Character Sheet and Token to work with the APIs as that creature, setting all necessary fields and setting the Token as the default token for the Character Sheet. At this point the token can immediately be used in play as that creature.</li>'
							+'<li>Selecting a Race and/or Class & level for the Character Sheet will not do as much - the basics will be set, but'
								+'<ul><li>the Character Attributes of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma must be rolled for and added to the sheet manually</li>'
								+'<li>the Token is not linked or set up, as many fields still need to have values set</li>'
								+'<li>use the <i>Token-Setup</i> menu to add Character menu action buttons to the Character Sheet, which provide menu access for Players</li>'
								+'<li>the DM\'s <i>Token-Setup</i> menu can be used to complete setting other aspects of the character before play</li>'
								+'<li>if appropriate, once everything is set up manually make the token the default for the Character Sheet</li></ul>'
							+'<li>Use either the DM\'s <i>Add-Items</i> menu or the Character\'s <i>Attk-Menu / Edit Weapons & Armour</i> menu to add equipment including weapons & armour to Characters and even Creatures that can make use of them.</li>'
							+'<li>Use the Character\'s <i>Attk-Menu / Change Weapons</i> menu to take weapons, shields, and other items in-hand, ready to use in attacks.</li>'
							+'<li>Wizards and Priests can have spells added to their spell books on the DM\'s <i>Token-Setup / Add to Spellbook</i> menu. Then spells can be memorised from the spellbook using the Character\'s <i>Spell-Menu / Memorise Spells</i> menu.</li>'
							+'<li>There are many other features of the APIs that can be used to enhance the Character / NPC being created with Powers, Magic Items and Proficiencies with weapons and Fighting Styles. Explore the other help handouts that come with the APIs for more information.</li></ul>'
							+'<p>Alternatively, the Character Sheet can be set up manually from scratch, or existing Characters with Character Sheets can be adapted for use with the APIs.  This option is explored in the rest of this document. However, adding information (other than Character Attributes) to the Character Sheet manually will never be as functionally rich as using the APIs for setting up the sheet, and in some cases will restrict the operation of the APIs to not work in the optimal way. Always use the API menus where possible.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h3>2. Token configuration</h3>'
							+'<p>The API can work with any Token configuration but requires tokens that are going to participate in API actions to represent a Character Sheet, so that actions relevant to the token and the character it represents can be selected. </p>'
							+'<p>A single Character Sheet can have multiple Tokens representing it, and each of these are able to do individual actions made possible by the data on the Character Sheet jointly represented.  However, if such multi-token Characters / NPCs / creatures are likely to encounter spells that will affect the Character Sheet (such as <i>Haste</i> and <i>Slow</i>) they must be split with each Token representing a separate Character Sheet, or else the one spell will affect all tokens associated with the Character Sheet, whether they were targeted or not!  In fact, <b>it is recommended that tokens and character sheets are 1-to-1 to keep things simple.</b></p>'
							+'<p>The recommended Token Bar assignments for all APIs in the Master Series are:</p>'
							+'<pre>Bar1 (Green Circle):	Armour Class (AC field) - only current value<br>'
							+'Bar2 (Blue Circle):	Base Thac0 (thac0-base field) before adjustments - only current value<br>'
							+'Bar3 (Red Circle):	Hit Points (HP field) - current & max</pre>'
							+'<p>It is recommended to use these assignments, and they are the bar assignments set by the <b>CommandMaster API</b> if its facilities are used to set up the tokens.  However, the APIs will search for the most appropriate fields to use from the token and character sheet - only if the APIs can\'t find valid values will they revert to using these default fields on the token. All tokens must be set the same way, whatever way you eventually choose.</p>'
							+'<p>These default assignments can be changed in each API, by changing the <i>fields</i> object near the top of the <i>RPGMaster Library</i> API script (<b>note:</b> \'bar#\' and \'value\' or \'max\' are separate entries in an array of 2 elements):</p>'
							+'<pre>fields.Token_AC:	defines the token field for the AC value (normally [\'bar1\',\'value\'])<br>'
							+'fields.Token_MaxAC:	defines the token field for the AC max (normally [\'bar1\',\'max\'])<br>'
							+'fields.Token_Thac0:	defines the token field for the Thac0 value (normally [\'bar2\',\'value\'])<br>'
							+'fields.Token_MaxThac0: defines the token field for the Thac0 max (normally [\'bar2\',\'max\'])<br>'
							+'fields.Token_HP:	defines the token field for the HP value (normally [\'bar3\',\'value\'])<br>'
							+'fields.Token_MaxHP:	defines the token field for the HP max (normally [\'bar3\',\'max\'])</pre>'
							+'<p>Alter the bar numbers appropriately or, <b><u><i>if you are not wanting one or more of these assigned</i></u></b>: leave the two elements of the array as [\'\',\'\'].  The system will generally work fine with reassignment or no assignment, but not always, especially if Effect Macros are programmed with hard-coded field assignments rather than using ^^field-tag^^ redirects <i>(see RoundMaster API documentation for information on Effect Macros)</i>.</p>'
							+'<h3>3. Use with various game system character sheets</h3>'
							+'<p>The latest version of the RPGMaster series APIs use various game and character sheet-specific versions the <b>RPGMaster Library</b> to implement the relevant rules, parameters and databases specific to a game-version and/or Roll20 character sheet version.  Loading the correct RPGMaster Library will configure all the RPGMaster APIs to work with that game rule set and character sheet. <b>However:</b> at the time of writing, only the AD&D 2E game version, and Advanced D&D 2E Character Sheet by Peter B. are supported.</p>'
							+'<h3>4. Matching the API to a type of Character Sheet</h3>'
							+'<p>As with other game and character sheet specific configuration, selecting the correct RPGMaster Library will configure the RPGMaster APIs for the character sheet in use.  If a character sheet does not have the fields specified in the Library, the RPGMaster APIs will create them - it can, in fact, work with a totally blank character sheet definition and it will create all of the fields it requires from scratch: it just won\'t look very pretty or be very usable as a character sheet! However, you can alter the Library to work with any character sheet as follows (though the game rules and databases will remain those coded in that version of the Library).</p>'
							+'<p>The Library API has an object definition called \'fields\', which contains items of the form </p>'
							+'<pre>Internal_api_name: [sheet_field_name, field_attribute, optional_default_value, optional_set_with_worker_flag]</pre>'
							+'<p>A typical example might be:</p>'
							+'<pre>Fighter_level:[\'level-class1\',\'current\'],<br>'
							+'Or<br>'
							+'MUSpellNo_memable:[\'spell-level-castable\',\'current\',\'\',true],</pre>'
							+'<p>The <i>internal_api_name</i> <b><u>must not be altered!</b></u> Doing so will cause the system not to work.  However, the <i>sheet_field_name</i> and <i>field_attribute</i> can be altered to match any character sheet.</p>'
							+'<p>Table names are slightly different: always have an <i>internal_api_name</i> ending in \'_table\' and their definition specifies the repeating table name and the index of the starting row of the table or -1 for a static field as the 1<sup>st</sup> row.</p>'
							+'<pre>Internal_api_table: [sheet_repeating_table_name,starting_index]</pre>'
							+'<p>An example is:</p>'
							+'<pre>MW_table:[\'repeating_weapons\',0],</pre>'
							+'<p>The <i>internal_api_table</i> <b><u>must not be altered!</b></u> Doing so will cause the system not to work.  However, the <i>sheet_repeating_table_name</i> and <i>starting_index</i> can be altered to match any character sheet.</p>'
							+'<p>Each character sheet must have repeating tables to hold weapons, ammo and magic items, as well as other data (if it does not, or they are not the ones specified in the <i>fields</i> object, the APIs will create them).  By default, melee weapons \'in hand\' are held in sections of the repeating_weapons table, melee weapon damage in the repeating_weapons-damage table, ranged weapons in the repeating_weapons2 table, ammo in the repeating_ammo table, and magic items are held in the repeating_potions table.  The table management system provided by the API expands and writes to repeating attributes automatically, and the DM & Players do not need to worry about altering or updating any of these tables on the Character Sheet. If the Character Sheet does not have tables to display any specific table, the APIs will create the table and attach it to the sheet and will be able to use it, but the Players and DM will not see the content except through the API menus and dialogues.</p>'
							+'<h3>5. Character Attributes, Races, Classes and Levels</h3>'
							+'<p>Character Attributes of <i>Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom</i> and <i>Charisma</i> are generally not directly important to the RPGMaster Series APIs, but the resulting bonuses and penalties are.  All Attributes and resulting modifiers should be entered into the Character Sheet in the appropriate places (that is in the Character Sheet fields identified in the \'fields\' API object as noted in section 2 above).</p>'
							+'<p>The Character\'s race is also important for calculating saves and ability to use certain items.  The race should be set in the appropriate Character Sheet field.  Currently, the races <i>\'dwarf\', \'elf\', \'gnome\', \'halfelf\', \'halfling\', \'half-orc\'</i> and <i>\'human\'</i> are implemented (not case sensitive, and spaces, hyphens and underscores are ignored).  If not specified, <i>human</i> is assumed.  The race impacts saves, some magic items and armour, and bonuses on some attacks.</p>'
							+'<p>The system supports single-class and multi-class characters.  Classes must be entered in the appropriate fields on the Character Sheet - if using the <b>CommandMaster API</b>, the --abilities or --class-menu commands can be used to set the classes and levels of characters and NPCs.  Classes and levels affect spell casting ability, ability to do two-weapon attacks with or without penalty, and the ability to backstab and the related modifiers, among other things.  Class and level also determine valid weapons, armour, shields, some magic items and saves.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> the appropriate fields must be used for relevant classes - this varies by character sheet.  E.g. on the Advanced D&D 2e Character Sheet, Fighter classes must be in the first class column, Wizard classes in the second column, Priest classes in the third, Rogues in the fourth, and Psions (or any others) in the fifth.  If manually adding classes, it is important that these locations are adhered to.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> classes of Fighter and Rogue (such as Rangers and Bards) that can use clerical &/or wizard spells will automatically be allowed to cast spells once they reach the appropriate level by the specific game version rules, but not before.  They <b><u>do not</b></u> need to have levels set in the corresponding spell-caster columns - the casting ability & level is worked out by the system</p>'
							+'<p>The Class-DB database holds definitions of the classes and class rules distributed with the system.  If the MagicMaster API is loaded, use the !magic --extract-db Class-DB command to extract the database to a character sheet to examine and update the class rules.  Examples of Classes currently supported are:</p>'
							+'<table><thead><tr><td>Fighter classes</td><td>Wizard Classes</td><td>Priest Classes</td><td>Rogue Classes</td></tr></thead>'
							+'<tr><td>Warrior</td><td>Wizard</td><td>Priest</td><td>Rogue</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Mage</td><td>Cleric</td><td>Thief</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Abjurer</td><td>Druid</td><td>Bard</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Conjurer</td><td>Healer</td><td>Assassin</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Beastmaster</td><td>Diviner</td><td>Priest of Life</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Enchanter</td><td>Priest of War	</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Defender (Dwarven)</td><td>Illusionist</td><td>Priest of Light</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td> </td><td>Invoker</td><td>Priest of Knowledge</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td> </td><td>Necromancer</td><td>Shaman</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td> </td><td>Transmuter</td></tr></table>'
							+'<p>The level for each class must be entered in the corresponding field.  Multiple classes and levels can be entered, and will be dealt with accordingly.  Generally, the most beneficial outcome for any combination will be used.  </p>'
							+'<h3>6. Magic Items and Equipment</h3>'
							+'<p>All magic items and standard equipment, including weapons, armour, lanterns etc, are held in the Items table, which by default is set to the potions table, <i>repeating_potions</i>, on the Character Sheet.  As with other fields, this can be changed in the <i>\'fields\'</i> object.  The best way to put items into this table is by using the <b>MagicMaster API</b> commands <b>--edit-mi</b> or the GM-only command <b>--gm-edit-mi</b>.  Alternatively, the <b>AttackMaster --edit-weapons</b> command can be used to load weapons, ammunition and armour into the Items table.  It is generally possible to enter item names and quantities directly into the table and use them within the system, but only items that also exist in the supplied databases will actually work fully with the API (i.e. be recognised by the API as weapons, armour, ammo, etc).  Other items can be in the table but will not otherwise be effective.</p>'
							+'<p>Items can be added to the databases.  See the Database Handouts for more information on the databases.</p>'
							+'<h3>7. Weapons and Ammo</h3>'
							+'<p>For the APIs to work fully the melee weapons, damage, ranged weapons and ammo must be selected using the <b>AttackMaster --weapon</b> command to take the weapon \'in hand\'.  This will display a menu to take weapons and shields from the Items table and take them in hand, ready to use.  This automatically fills all the correct fields for the weapons and ammo to make attacks, including many fields that are not displayed.  Entering weapon data directly into the melee weapon, damage, ranged weapon and ammo tables will generally work, but will be overwritten if the --weapon command is used.  Also, some API functions may not work as well or at all.</p>'
							+'<p>For the <b>InitiativeMaster API</b> to support weapon attack actions weapon name, speed and number of attacks are the most important fields.  For the <b>AttackMaster API</b> to support attack rolls, proficiency calculations, ranged attacks, strength and dexterity bonuses, and other aspects of functionality, fill in as many fields as are visible on the character sheet.  When entering data manually, ensure that the row a melee or ranged weapon is in matches the row damage or ammo is entered in the respective tables (there is no need to do this if using AttackMaster functions to take weapons in-hand, as the relevant lines are otherwise linked).</p>'
							+'<h3>8. Weapon Proficiencies</h3>'
							+'<p>Weapon Proficiencies must be set on the Character Sheet.  This is best done by using the <b>CommandMaster API</b> character sheet management functions, but can be done manually.  Both specific weapons and related weapon groups can be entered in the table, and when a Player changes the character\'s weapons in-hand the table of proficiencies will be consulted to set the correct bonuses and penalties.  Weapon specialisation and mastery (otherwise known as double specialisation) are supported by the CommandMaster functions, but can also be set by ticking/selecting the relevant fields on the Character Sheet weapon proficiencies table.  If a weapon or its related weapon group does not appear in the list, it will be assumed to be not proficient.</p>'
							+'<h3>8. Spell books and memorisable spells</h3>'
							+'<p>The best (and easiest) way to give a Character or NPC spells and powers is to use <b>CommandMaster API</b> to add spells and powers to the Character\'s spellbooks, and <b>MagicMaster API</b> to memorise and cast spells and use powers.  However, for the purposes of just doing initiative and selecting which spell to cast in the next round, the spells and powers can be entered manually onto the character sheet.  Spells are held in the relevant section of the Spells table, which by default is set to the character sheet spells table, <i>repeating_spells</i>.  As with other fields, this can be changed in the <i>\'fields\'</i> object.  Note that on the Advanced D&D 2e character sheet Wizard spells, Priest spells & Powers are all stored in various parts of this one very large table.</p>'
							+'<p>If you are just using the character sheet fields to type into, add spells (or powers) to the relevant "Spells Memorised" section (using the [+Add] buttons to add more as required) <b>a complete row at a time</b> (that is add columns before starting the next row).  Enter the spell names into the "Spell Name" field, and "1" into each of the "current" & "maximum" "Cast Today" fields - the API suite <i>counts down</i> to zero on using a spell, so in order for a spell to appear as available (not greyed out) on the initiative menus, the "current" number left must be > 0.  This makes spells consistent with other tables in the system (e.g. potion dose quantities also count down as they are consumed, etc).</p>'
							+'<p>Then, you need to set the "Spell Slots" values on each level of spell to be correct for the level of caster.  Just enter numbers into each of the "Level", "Misc." and "Wisdom" (for Priests) fields, and/or tick "Specialist" for the Wizard levels as relevant.  This will determine the maximum number of spells memorised each day, that will appear in the spells Initiative Menu.  Do the same for Powers using the "Powers Available" field.  As with other fields on the character sheet, each of these fields can be re-mapped by altering the <i>\'fields\'</i> object in the <i>RPGMaster Library</i> API.</p>'
							+'<p>Spells can only be cast if they have macros defined in the spell databases (see Spell Database Handout).  If the <b>CommandMaster API</b> is loaded, the DM can use the tools provided there to manage Character, NPC & creature spell books and granted powers from the provided spell & power databases.</p>'
							+'<p>The spells a spell caster can memorise (what they have in their spell books, or what their god has granted to them) is held as a list of spell names separated by vertical bars \'|\' in the character sheet attribute defined in <i>fields.Spellbook</i> (on the AD&D2E character sheet \'spellmem\') of each level of spell.  On the AD&D2E sheet, the spell books are the large Spell Book text fields at the bottom of each spell level tab.  The spell names used must be identical (though not case sensitive) to the spell ability macro names in the spell databases (hence the hyphens in the names).   So, for example, a 1<sup>st</sup> level Wizard might have the following in their large Wizard Level 1 spell book field:</p>'
							+'<pre>Armour|Burning-Hands|Charm-Person|Comprehend-Languages|Detect-Magic|Feather-fall|Grease|Identify|Light|Magic-Missile|Read-Magic|Sleep</pre>'
							+'<p>Only these spells will be listed as ones they can memorise at level 1.  When they learn new spells and put them in their spell book, this string can be added to just by typing into it.  When they reach 3<sup>rd</sup> level and can have 2<sup>nd</sup> level spells, the following string might be put in the spell book on the Level 2 Wizard spells tab:</p>'
							+'<pre>Alter-Self|Invisibility|Melfs-Acid-Arrow|Mirror-Image|Ray-of-Enfeeblement</pre>'
							+'<p>Again, as they learn more spells and put them in their spell book, just edit the text to add the spells.</p>'
							+'<p>Once these spell books are defined, the DM or Player can use the <b>MagicMaster --mem-spell</b> command (or an action button and associated ability macro on the Character Sheet) to memorise the correct number of these spells in any combination and store those on the Character Sheet.</p>'
							+'<h3>9. Powers</h3>'
							+'<p>Powers are defined in the Powers database - see Database handouts - though it is possible to use Wizard or Priest spells as powers.  If the <b>CommandMaster API</b> is also loaded, the DM can use the tools provided there to manage Character, NPC & creature spellbooks and granted powers.</p>'
							+'<p>Powers work in an almost identical way to Wizard & Priest spells, except that there is only 1 level of powers.  Powers that the character has are added to the spell book on the Powers tab in the same way as spells, and then memorised using the <b>--mem-spell</b> command (which also works for powers with the right parameters).  If you want to add Wizard or Priest spells as powers that can be used one or more times a day, or at will, the <b>CommandMaster</b> token setup  spellbook function allows spells to be added to the powers spellbook. Otherwise, just add the name of the spell with a prefix of "MU-" or "PR-" manually to the powers spellbook e.g. to add a Wizard Light spell as a power, add it to the powers spellbook as "MU-Light". Spells added in this way can be memorised as powers in exactly the same way as other powers.</p>'

							+'<h1>Weapon and Armour Databases</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for AttackMaster v'+version+'</i> and later</h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster APIs use a number of databases to hold Ability Macros defining weapons, ammo, and items of armour and their specifications, defined in the RPGMaster Library for various game versions. Previous versions of the RPGMaster series of APIs held their databases all externally as character sheets: from this version onwards this is not the case for databases supplied with the APIs, which are now held internally to the APIs. However, the AttackMaster or MagicMaster API command <b>--extract-db</b> can be used to extract any or all standard databases to Character Sheets for examination and update. DMs can add their own weapons, ammo and armour to additional databases held as Character Sheets. Additional databases should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table><tr><td>Weapons:</td><td>additional databases: MI-DB-Weapons-[added name] where [added name] can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Ammo:</td><td>additional databases: MI-DB-Ammo-[added name] where [added name] can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Armour:</td><td>additional databases: MI-DB-Armour-[added name] where [added name] can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr></table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. MI-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want.  Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> databases extracted using the <b>--extract-db</b> command will be able to be edited, but will also slow the system down - the versions held internally in the APIs are much faster for the system to access. Once any extracted database has been examined, it is best to delete them and use the <b>--check-db</b> to re-index the databases so the system operates as fast as possible.</p>'
							+'<p>Each database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul><li>Ability Macros named as the weapon, ammo or armour specified, and used to describe and provide specifications for using the commands with the AttackMaster API;</li>'
							+'<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the speed and type for each item;</li>'
							+'<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (various spell books for different items - see entry below);</li>'
							+'<li>Optionally, some entries come also with attributes that define Powers and Spells delivered by or stored on the item.</li></ul>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> a DM only needs to program the Ability Macro using the formats shown in the next section, and then run the <b>!attk --check-db</b> or <b>!magic --check-db</b> command, which will correctly parse the ability macro and set the rest of the database entries as needed.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired. Roll Templates are very useful when defining ability macros - the RPGMaster Library provides several new Roll Templates that do not rely on any particular Character Sheet: <i>RPGMweapon, RPGMammo, and RPGMarmour</i> are the most relevant. See the RPGMaster Library help handout for further information.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster views the specifications of a weapon, ammunition or piece of armour, the APIs run the relevant Ability Macro from the databases as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Provided Weapons</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any item provided in any of the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases with exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<h2>2. Weapon & Ammunition Databases</h2>'
							+'<p>Weapon databases are all character sheets that have names that start with MI-DB-Weapon (though in fact, weapons can be in any database starting with MI-DB- if desired), and can have anything put at the end, though those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.  Ammunition databases are similar, with the root database MI-DB-Ammo.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated, each weapon definition has 3 (or 4) parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and matches the weapon, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with other weapons, and sometimes Attributes defining powers given by, or spells stored on the item. The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract the root databases and take a look (but remember to delete them after exploring the items in them, so as not to slow the system down unnecessarily).</p>'

Clearly, there are some exceptions like a Basterd Sword which is designed to be used as either 1-handed or 2-handed and gains extra damage from doing so.</p>'
							+'<b>However:</b> certain 1-handed weapons gain benefits when a character has proficiency in the <i>Two-Hander Fighting Style</i>, and perhaps with other (custom) fighting styles the DM chooses to set up. However, those without these proficiencies should not gain benefit from 2-handed use of these weapons. To achieve this outcome, these weapons need to be specified in a particular fashion in the Weapons Database.  Here is an example:</p>'
							+'<h3>Battle Axe</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMweapon}{{name=Battle Axe}} {{subtitle=Axe}} {{Speed=[[7]]}} {{Size=Medium}} {{Weapon=1-handed melee axe}} <mark style="color:green">Specs=[Battle-Axe,Melee,1H,Axe],[Battle-Axe,Melee,2H,Axe]</mark> {{To-hit=+0 + Str Bonus}} <mark style="color:blue">ToHitData=[w:Battle Axe,sb:1,+:0,n:1,ch:20,cm:1,sz:M,ty:S,r:5,sp:7,rc:uncharged]</mark> {{Attacks=1 per round + specialisation & level, Slashing}} {{Damage=+0, SM:1d8, L:1d12 + Str Bonus}} DmgData=[w:Battle Axe,sb:1,+:0,SM:1d8,L:1d12] {{desc=A standard Battle Axe of good quality, but nothing special}}</p>'
							+'<p>Here it can be seen that there are two data sets specified for the <i>Specs</i> field and only one data set specified for the <i>ToHitData</i>. Doing this tells the APIs that this weapon can be taken in both hands, but generally will not gain any different advantages. If a Character is proficient or specialised in Two-Hander Fighting Style, however, the APIs will see that this is a 1-handed weapon held in both hands, and allocate it the correct benefits. But only certain weapons gain these benefits, so only certain weapons in the database should be set up this way.</p>'

							+'<p>As previously stated and as per the weapon and ammunition databases, each armour definition has 3 parts in the database (see Section 1): the Ability Macro, the ct- attribute, and the listing (and occasionally attributes for powers and spells).  The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract to the root databases and take a look (but remember to delete them after examination and use the --check-db command to re-index the databases).</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b>The DM creating new armour entries does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the <b>!attk --check-db MI-DB-Armour</b> or <b>!magic --check-db MI-DB-Armour</b> command will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases that have a name starting with or including \'MI-DB-Armour\', as long as the Specs and Data fields are correctly defined.

							+'<h1>Spell, Power & Magic Item Databases</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for MagicMaster v'+version+' and later</i></h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The MagicMaster API uses a number of databases to hold Ability Macros defining spells, powers and magic items and their effects.  The databases are distributed in the game-version-specific <b>RPGMasther Library</b> with many spell, power & magic item definitions.  DMs can add their own weapons, ammo and armour to additional databases. Additional databases should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Wizard Spells:</th><td>additional databases: MU-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Priest Spells:</th><td>additional databases: PR-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Powers:</th><td>additional databases: Powers-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Magic Items:</th><td>additional databases: MI-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. MI-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want. Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p>Each Character Sheet database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+'	<li>Ability Macros named as the spell, power or magic item specified, and used to describe and provide effects for spells, powers and magic items using the commands in the Magic Master API;</li>'
							+'	<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the casting time and casting cost for spells & powers, and speed and MI type for magic items;</li>'
							+'	<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (Spell Level of the spell defined, Powers tab, or various spell books for different Magic Items - see MI entry below).</li>'
							+'</ul>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired. Roll Templates are very useful when defining spell, power and magic item ability macros.  When a Player or an NPC or Creature views or casts a spell, power or uses a magic item the Magic Master API runs the relevant Ability Macro from the databases as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<p>When a Character, NPC or Creature views or uses an item, or views or casts a spell or power, the system searches the relevant databases for an item, spell or power with the selected name, and copies any database ability macro so found to the Character Sheet of the Character, NPC or Creature - if it already exists it will overwrite it with the latest version. If the system can\'t find a matching entry in any of the databases, API supplied or GM created, it then searches the Character Sheet for a matching ability macro previously saved there - this caters for the character/NPC/creature being moved to a new campaign that, for instance, does not hold a particular GM-created database item, as the macros the Character Sheet needs are always held on it.</p>'
							+'<p>Whenever a new gameplay session is started, or the <b>--check-db</b> command is run, the system indexes all database items, both those in API memory and those held in Character Sheet databases: Character Sheet database items in user-defined databases take preference over API databases extracted to Character Sheet databases, which in turn take preference over API databases held in memory.  This index speeds up access to the database items. However, items in Character Sheet databases are still much slower for the system to access than items in the API databases in memory. Thus it is best not to use extracted API databases in live gameplay, but only for copying items to support development of GM-created items in a GM\'s own databases. After use, the extracted API databases can just be deleted.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Spells & Items</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any spell or item provided in any of the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases with exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>2. Spells and Powers Databases</h2>'
							+'<p>Spells/Powers databases have names that start with</p>'
							+'<p>	<b>Wizard Spells:</b>	MU-Spells-DB-[added name]<br>'
							+'	<b>Priest Spells:</b>	PR-Spells-DB-[added name]<br>'
							+'	<b>Powers:</b>			Powers-DB-[added name]</p>'
							+'<p>Those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated, each spell or power definition has 3 parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and matches the spell or power, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", and a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with others of the same level in the spell book of the level of the spell or power.  The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract the root databases using the <b>!magic --extract-db</b> command, and take a look (but remember to delete it after viewing to speed things up, and then reindex the databases using <b>!magic --check-db</b>)</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new spells and powers does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases, as long as the Specs and Data fields are correctly defined. Use the name of the particular database as a parameter to check and update just that database.  Running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability macros can be added to a database just by using the [+Add] button at the top of the Abilities column in the Attributes and Abilities tab of the Database Character Sheet, and then using the edit "pencil" icon on the new entry to open it for editing.  Ability macros are standard Roll20 functionality and not dependent on the API.  Refer to the Roll20 Help Centre for more information.</p>'

							+'<p>In this case, there are multiple repeating datasets in each data section: there are three possible variants of the Spiritual Hammer depending on the caster\'s level.

The mere presence of the character is not enough--a touch of drama from the character is important. Speech and gestures are important, so the character must have his hands free and be in a position to speak. However, turning is not like spellcasting and is not interrupted if the character is attacked during the attempt.<br>'
							+'To resolve a turning attempt, look on Table 61. Cross-index the Hit Dice or type of the undead with the level of the character (two levels lower for a paladin).

If the letter "T" (for "turned") appears, the attempt is automatically successful without a die roll. If the letter "D" (for "dispel") is given, the turning utterly destroys the undead. A dash (--) means that a priest or paladin of that level cannot turn that type of undead. A successful turn or dispel affects 2d6 undead. If the undead are a mixed group, the lowest Hit Dice creatures are turned first.<br>'

							+'<p>The power, spell or magic item name used with the <i>desc:</i> field tag will be searched for in all the appropriate databases.  However, some exist in more than one context (e.g. <i>Light</i> is both a Wizard and a Priest spell). It is possible to specify where the specific description can be found by preceding the name with one of "PW-", "MU-", "PR-", or "MI-" for Power, Wizard spell, Priest spell, and Magic Item respectively. Specifying the type also speeds up the search.</p>'

							+'<p>Generally speaking, the <i>cmd:</i> and <i>msg:</i> tags can be used together instead of a <i>desc:</i> if there is no equivalent spell or power to display and only a simple status, timer or effect results from the magical attack. The <i>pw:</i> tag operates in an almost identical way to <i>desc:</i> but decrements the <i>"per day"</i> uses for the named power/spell (specified in the item data specification - see Section 4.1 below) each time it is used, which refresh after a Long Rest.</p>'
							+'<h3>3.4 Hiding Magic Item Details</h3>'
							+'<p>Sometimes, GMs want Players to have to discover the properties of magic items through quests, spell use, trial and error, or paying a high-level wizard to identify them. This is not always the case, and some groups may prefer for some or all items to reveal their nature on first examination. The database specification of an item allows for both approaches. An example of how to define an item to make it easy to hide its details is </p>'
							+'<h3>Flask of Curses</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMitem}<mark style="color:black">{{title=Flask}}{{name= of Curses}}</mark>{{subtitle=Magic Item}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[Flask of Curses,Miscellaneous,1H,Alteration]</mark>{{Speed=[[3]]}}<mark style="color:orange">MiscData=[w:Flask of Curses,st:Flask,wt:1,sp:3,qty:1,rc:charged]</mark>{{Size=S}}<mark style="color:red">{{Looks Like=An ordinary flask of some type, containing a little liquid of some unidentifyable sort}}</mark>{{Use=The GM will tell you what happens when you use this item}}{{desc=This item looks like an ordinary beaker, bottle, container, decanter, flask, or jug.

Or perhaps a monster could appear and attack all creatures in sight.}}</p>'
							+'<p>Four elements contribute to the "simple" approach to being able to hide the item details from the Player / Character:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+	'<li>The splitting of the title & name of the definition: title is always displayed, and name is only added to the title when hidden details are made displayable by the GM.</li>'
							+	'<li>The optional addition of the <b>st:</b> attribute in the <i>MiscData</i> specification, which specifies the name of the item displayed on buttons while details are hidden. If not specified, defaults to the item class.</li>'
							+	'<li>The addition of the <i>Looks Like</i> tag which marks text that replaces the <i>desc</i>ription while details are hidden and until the GM reveals the details.</li>'
							+	'<li>The <i>Hide item as other item</i> function in the GM\'s <i>Add Items</i> dialog, which will be available for items that have the <i>Looks Like</i> tag, or for which the GM chooses another item to hide this one as.</p>'
							+'</ul>'
							+'<p>The key element is the inclusion of the <i>Looks Like</i> data tag in the definition of the item. If an item has this tag, the GM\'s <i>Add Items</i> dialog will have the <i>Hide Item as Item</i> button enabled to hide the item as either what the <b>st:</b> data attribute specifies or (if not specified) the item class in the <i>Specs</i> specification of the item. If a player character views or uses such a hidden item, they will see only the <i>title</i> and the <i>Looks Like</i> text and nothing else. The GM can either set the item to automatically reveal its "secrets" when the player character <i>views</i> the item, <i>uses</i> the item, or only when revealed <i>manually</i> by the GM. It is also possible for the GM to select to hide the item as a completely different item using the <i>Add Items</i> dialog. For full details see the <b>--gm-edit-mi</b> entry in the <i>MagicMaster Help</i> handout.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>4. Magic Items with Powers or Spell-Storing</h2>'
							+'<p>Some magic items, especially artefacts and sentient items, can store spells and/or have powers similar to characters.  MagicMaster supports magic items of this type to a degree, although there are inevitably exceptions that the DM will have to get creative in their development!  These items use API buttons that call various MagicMaster commands to deliver their capabilities.</p>'
							+'<p>First to note is that <b>items that have powers and spells use spell slots in the owning character\'s character sheet</b>.  These spell slots should not be used by characters in your campaign.  If they are, errors might occur.  By default, on the AD&D2E character sheet the system uses Wizard Level 14 spell slots for magic item powers, and Wizard Level 15 spell slots for spell-storing magic items.  As standard AD&D2E only has spells up to level 9 this generally works without causing problems.</p>'
							+'<p>Next, in addition to the three standard elements of the Ability Macro, the \'ct-\' attribute and the listing, these items require a 4th element which specifies their powers and spells.  These are:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">mi-muspells-[item-name]:</th><td>Wizard spells able to be stored in the magic item</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">mi-prspells-[item-name]:</th><td>Priest spells able to be stored in the magic item</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">mi-powers-[item-name]:</th><td>Powers able to be used by the magic item</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p>In each case the <i>[item-name]</i> is replaced by the Ability macro name (which is not case sensitive).</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new spell storing or power wielding magic items does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases, as long as the Specs and Data fields are correctly defined. Use the name of the particular database as a parameter to check and update just that database.  Running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>When a spell-storing or power wielding magic item is added to a magic item bag or container using --edit-mi or --gm-edit-mi, these attributes are automatically added to the character sheet by the APIs and also they are parsed by the system and the spells and/or powers are created in the relevant spell books automatically.  When such an item is found in a container by a character, or passed from character to character, all of the stored spells & powers are deleted from the old character and created in the new character.  A character gaining such an item can use its spells and powers immediately.</p>'

If no prefix is specified, the system will first search the Powers Databases (API-supplied and user-supplied) for a match and, if not found there, will then search the MU Spells Databases, the Priest Spells Databases, all Magic Items databases, and then the character sheet of the creature wielding the item power for a match, in that order.

Note that if a single Character picks up two versions of exactly the same spell storing item (i.e. with the same item name) the results are unpredicable... The GM should use the <b>--gm-edit-mi</b> menu to rename one or both of the rings to give them unique names.</p>'
							+'<h3>4.3 Magic-Item-storing Items</h3>'
							+'<p>Some items can store other items, including magic items. When such an item is viewed, used or exchanged between containers and characters, a character sheet specifically for the MI-storing item is created, or found if already previously created. The very act of viewing or using the item will trigger the creation or selection - there is no need for the GM or Player to do so. An example of this is a Bag of Holding.</p>'
							+'<h3>Bag of Holding</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMitem}{{name=Bag of Holding}}{{subtitle=Magic Item}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[Bag of Holding,Miscellaneous,1H,Alteration]</mark>{{Size=[[15]]/[[250]]lbs, 30cu.ft}}<mark style="color:blue">MiscData=[w:Bag of Holding,st:Bag,sp:0,rc:uncharged,bag:2],[cl:MI,w:Potion-of-Healing,qty:1],[cl:MI,w:Scroll of Protection vs Magic,qty:2]</mark>{{Access=Drag the *Bag of Holding* token onto the map and use your MI menu *Search* function (to retrieve stuff from it) or *Store* function (to put stuff in it)}}{{desc=As with other magical bags, this one appears to be a common cloth sack of about 2 feet by 4 feet size. The Bag of Holding opens into a nondimensional space, and its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into this item, the bag always weighs a fixed amount. This weight, the bag\'s weight limit in contents, and its volume limit are 15 lbs. 250 lbs. 30 cu. ft.<br>'
							+'If overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag will rupture and be ruined. The contents will be lost forever in the vortices of nilspace.}}</p>'
							+'<p>The important attributes are:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">bag:</th><td>&lt;#&gt;</td><td>Identifies the item as generating an item character sheet. Up to # items can be defined as initially being held in the item sheet (default 0)</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">cl:</th><td>\'MI\'</td><td>Subsequent data sets with class \'MI\' define items initially held in the item, and will be inserted in a newly created item sheet when first viewed or used</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">w:</th><td>&lt;text&gt;</td><td>The name of the item to initially be stored in the item character sheet MI bag.  Should be an item named in a database</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">qty:</th><td>&lt;#&gt;</td><td>The initial quantity of this item to be stored in the item-holding item character sheet MI bag (default 1)</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p>And one additional new attribute:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">st:</th><td>\'\'</td><td>Defines the "Item Type" (or SuperType) to be displayed when a container is searched that has its properties set to only show the types of items contained. If not provided, defaults to the <i>item class</i> from the <i>Specs</i> definition</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p>Thus, the definition of the particular Bag of Holding defined above, when a character has it in their Items & Equipment and either views or uses the item, will result in a new separate character sheet being created, named "Bag of Holding" (same as the item), placed in the controlling Player\'s journal and marked as controlled by that player, and for one Potion of Healing and two Scrolls of Protection vs. Magic to be inserted automatically into the Bag of Holding, ready for the Character to find and use by dragging the bag onto the map from their Journal and Searching the Bag.</p>'
							+'<p>Once the Bag is created, the existing items can be taken out into the Character\'s own items & equipment, or new ones placed in the bag, the bag passed from one Character to another or itself placed in a different container.</p>'
							+'<p>It is recommended that, where a GM places multiple item-holding items in a campaign, such as multiple Bags of Holding, that the GM uses the functions of the [Add Items] menu to rename each with a different name in the original container to which they are placed and before each is viewed or used (i.e. before the item character sheet is created by the system) - perhaps naming each after some previous owner or its creator.  This prevents confusion with multiple Character Sheets all with the same name (which Roll20 will allow, but can definately be confusing for the GM who will see them all even if players only see the ones they control).</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>5. Weapons (if using AttackMaster API)</h2>'
							+'<p>Weapons, magical or not, are special types of items in the Magic Items databases.  If coded properly (in the same way as those in the MI-DB-Weapons database), they can be used with the <b>AttackMaster API</b> to implement fully automatic weapon management, the ability to hold weapons "in-hand" or sheathed, to have automatic ammo and range management for ranged weapons, automatic entry of weapons into the melee and/or ranged weapons tables, ready to make attacks with magical plusses and other specifications all set up, and support for dancing weapons (ones that can attack without being held by the Character), creatures with more than 2 hands, and 1-handed weapons, 2-handed weapons, and even weapons that need more than 2 hands!</p>'
							+'<p>See the <b>Weapon & Armour Database Help</b> handout and AttackMaster API documentation for how Weapon definitions should be structured for use with the AttackMaster API, which are just a few additions to the standard definition of an item.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>6. Armour & Shields</h2>'
							+'<p>Like weapons, armour and shields of all types (including magical armour like magical Bracers and Rings of Protection) can be coded to be used with the <b>AttackMaster API</b> to automatically calculate the appropriate AC for various scenarios (such as with & without Shield, from the back, if surprised, etc).  This will take into account if the armour is valid for the character class, determine which is the best armour combination that the character has, if various armour elements can or can\'t work together, and add in Dexterity bonuses or impairments.  It will also allow magical effects cast on the character to take effect or be adjusted via the token "circles" and highlight when such an effect is in place by showing the relevant token bar (only when there is a difference between the token AC and calculated AC).</p>'
							+'<p>See the <b>Weapon & Armour Database Help</b> handout and AttackMaster API documentation for how Armour & Shield definitions should be structured for use with the AttackMaster API, which are just a few additions to the standard definition of an item.</p>'

							+'<h6><i>for RPGMaster APIs</i></h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster APIs use a number of databases to hold Macros defining races, creatures, character classes, spells, powers and magic items and their effects. Previous versions of the RPGMaster series of APIs held their databases all externally as character sheets: from this version onwards this is not the case for databases supplied with the APIs, which are now held internally to the APIs. However, the AttackMaster or MagicMaster API command <b>--extract-db</b> can be used to extract any or all standard databases to Character Sheets for examination and update. The APIs are distributed with many class, spell, power & magic item definitions, and DMs can add their own character classes, spells, items, weapons, ammo and armour to additional databases in their own database character sheets, with new definitions for database items held in Ability Macros. Additional database character sheets should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Wizard Spells:</th><td>additional databases: MU-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Priest Spells:</th><td>additional databases: PR-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Powers:</th><td>additional databases: Powers-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Magic Items:</th><td>additional databases: MI-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Character Classes:</th><td>additional databases: Class-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Races & Creatures:</th><td>additional databases: Race-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Attack Calculations:</th><td>additional databases: Attacks-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. MI-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want. Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p>Each added database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+'	<li>Ability Macros named as the class, spell, power or magic item specified, and used to describe and provide effects for classes, spells, powers and magic items using the commands in the RPGMaster APIs;</li>'
							+'	<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the casting time and casting cost for spells & powers, and speed and MI type for magic items (not currently used for Class or Attack definitions);</li>'
							+'	<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (Spell Level of the spell defined, Powers tab, or various spell books for different Classes & Magic Items - see Class entry below).</li>'
							+'</ul>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired. Roll Templates are very useful when defining class, spell, power and magic item ability macros.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster views or casts a spell, power or uses a magic item the Magic Master API runs the relevant Ability Macro from the databases as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Races, Classes, Spells & Items</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any Ability Macro provided in any of the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases with exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>2. Character Class Database</h2>'
							+'<p>The DM can add Character Class databases as character sheets that have names that start with Class-DB. The Class definitions that come with the installed game-version-specific <b>RPGMaster Library</b> can be extracted to a character sheet and viewed by using the <i><b>!magic --extract-db Class-DB</b> or <b>!attk --extract-db Class-DB</b></i> commands.  <b>Note:</b> it is best to delete the extracted Class-DB database character sheet after viewing/using, so that the system uses the much faster internal database version. After deleting or changing any character sheet database, always run the <i><b>!magic --check-db</b> or <b>!attk --check-db</b></i> command to re-index the databases.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Classes:</b>	Class-DB-<i>[added name]</i></p>'
							+'<p>Those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated, each class definition has 3 parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and matches the Class being defined, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", and a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with others of the same base class: the base classes being "Warrior", "Wizard", "Priest", "Rogue", and "Psion".  The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract the root database using the <b><i>--extract-db</i></b> command and take a look (remember to delete it after viewing - see above)</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new classes does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases, as long as the Specs and Data fields in the Ability Macros are correctly defined. Use the name of the particular database as a parameter to check and update just that database.  Running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability macros can be added to a database just by using the [+Add] button at the top of the Abilities column in the Attributes and Abilities tab of the Database Character Sheet, and then using the edit "pencil" icon on the new entry to open it for editing.  Ability macros are standard Roll20 functionality and not dependent on the API.  Refer to the Roll20 Help Centre for more information.</p>'

They have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and dark hair. Dwarves tend to be dour and taciturn. They are given to hard work and care little for most humor. They are strong and brave. They enjoy beer, ale, mead, and even stronger drink. Their chief love, however, is precious metal, particularly gold. They prize gems, of course, especially diamonds and opaque gems (except pearls, which they do not like). Dwarves like the earth and dislike the sea. Not overly fond of elves, they have a fierce hatred of orcs and goblins. Their short, stocky builds make them ill-suited for riding horses or other large mounts (although ponies present no difficulty), so they tend to be a trifle dubious and wary of these creatures. They are ill-disposed toward magic and have little talent for it, but revel in fighting, warcraft, and scientific arts such as engineering.<br>'
							+'Though dwarves are suspicious and avaricious, their courage and tenacity more than compensate for these shortcomings.<br>'

							+'One aspect that makes the vampire far more fearful than many of its undead kindred is its appearance. Unlike other undead creatures, the vampire can easily pass among normal men without drawing attention to itself for, although its facial features are sharp and feral, they do not seem inhuman.

							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. MI-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want. Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p>Each added database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+'	<li>Ability Macros named as the class, spell, power or magic item specified, and used to describe and provide effects for classes, spells, powers and magic items using the commands in the RPGMaster APIs;</li>'
							+'	<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the casting time and casting cost for spells & powers, and speed and MI type for magic items (not currently used for Class or Attack definitions);</li>'
							+'	<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (Spell Level of the spell defined, Powers tab, or various spell books for different Classes & Magic Items - see Class entry below).</li>'
							+'</ul>'
							+'<p>However, as with all other Databases in the RPGMaster Suite of APIs, if the <i>Ability Macros</i> are correctly set up using the formats detailed in the Help Documentation, the <b>AttackMaster API</b> command <b>!attk --check-db database-name</b> will check the database and set up all other aspects for you, including the correct Custom Attributes and List entries.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired. Roll Templates are very useful when defining class, spell, power and magic item ability macros, and are an essential part of Attack Templates.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster makes an attack, the AttackMaster API runs the relevant Ability Macro from the databases as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Database Items</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any Ability Macro provided in any of the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases (a database with the same root name) with the Ability Macro you create having exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>2. How Attacks Work</h2>'
							+'<p>In order to understand the Attacks Database, it is first important to understand how attacks are executed by the <b>AttackMaster API</b>.  Under some (if not all) versions of D&D, and especially <i>AD&D 2nd Edition</i>, attacks are quite complex involving many factors that can vary from moment to moment.  Some say that this is why they prefer RPG systems that require less maths and are faster to execute, that the complexity of the AD&D2e combat system interrupts the flow of play.  The AttackMaster API handles attacks in such a way as to hide as much of that complexity from the players as possible, and thus allow game-play to flow and players to concentrate on the unfolding story.</p>'
							+'<p>In order for the API to achieve this, it must evaluate many factors "on the fly" such as current magical effects in place (generally or on individuals), the current attributes of a character (which can vary as they are affected by game play), the type, range and properties of the weapon combinations used at that point in time for that particular attack, and the effects of the race, class, level and proficiency of the character, among several others.  Given that these factors can vary even during a single round, each attack must be fully evaluated from scratch each time it is made.</p>'
							+'<p>Another issue is introduced by players feeling much more satisfied if they can see dice rolling for the attack, or they may want to use the Roll20 dice rolling mouse action, or even their own physical dice.  Unfortunately for API authors, at the time of writing the API it is only possible to display rolling 3D dice from Chat Window dice rolls, either typed in the entry box by the player or run from Macros displayed in the Chat Window - 3D dice will not work when called by or included in API calls and commands.</p>'
							+'<p>So how does the AttackMaster API achieve 3D dice rolls and attack calculations that can accelerate game-play?  The answer is that it uses Attack Template definitions which it parses and turns into Ability Macros on the Character Sheet of the character that selects to do an attack.  The Melee Weapon templates are parsed and the attack Ability Macros for each Melee weapon in-hand created on the Character Sheet as (in fact just before) the Attack chat window menu is displayed, and Ranged Weapon templates are parsed and their attack Ability Macros are created after the type of Ammo has been selected and just before the relevant range buttons on the Attack menu are enabled for the Player to select.  Monster attack templates are parsed just before the Monster Attack menu is shown, with a template "set" created for each defined Monster <i>innate</i> attack on the Monster character sheet tab.  When the Player selects a Melee weapon to attack with, or the relevant range button for a Ranged weapon or Monster attack, the API is then not actually involved at all - the Roll20 Chat Window button just selected is just doing a standard macro call to the relevant attack Ability Macro just created on the Character Sheet.  This also means the actual attacks happen at the fastest speed Roll20 can achieve as no API code is being run at that point.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>3. The Attacks Database</h2>'
							+'<p>The Attack Templates are stored in the internal API Attacks Database, which can be exposed in Character Sheet Database form as <i>Attacks-DB</i> using the AttackMaster <b>!attk --extract-DB Attacks-DB</b> command. Attack Templates can also exist in additional bespoke Attacks Databases the DM/Game Creator adds using the Character Sheet name <i>Attacks-DB-[added name]</i>.  There are 12 basic Attack Templates:</p>'

							+'<p>The Melee Weapon Attack Templates will be parsed for each Melee Weapon in-hand at the time of the attack, and the Ranged Weapon Attack Templates will be parsed for each possible range of the Ranged Weapon/Ammo combination selected for the attack.

							+'</table>'
							+'<p>All of the above templates are provided in the Attacks-DB database supplied with the game version-specific RPGMaster Library API.  They are created to follow the rules of the game version supported by that specific library: DMs and Game Creators can create their own attack and damage calculations following whatever rules they want in their own bespoke Attacks Database, using the information provided in the next section.</p>'
							+'<p>It is possible to add additional Attack Templates that are specific to particular Races, Classes, or even individual weapons!  Indeed, the database supplied includes an example of a bespoke Attack Template set for a thrown prepared Oil Flask.  When an attack is the action selected by the Player, the API will search the Attacks-DB and bespoke user Attacks Databases for Melee and Ranged Attack Templates in the following name order (replace the ?W with either MW or RW as appropriate):</p>'
							+'<ol>'
							+'	<li><b>?W-ToHit-\< weapon name \> </b> Searches for a weapon-specific Attack Template set for the weapon being used to attack with, but if not found then</li>'

							+'	<li><b>?W-ToHit</b> Uses the default Attack Template set.</li>'
							+'</ol>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>4. Attack Data Fields</h2>'
							+'<p>Attack Templates can take the form of any message or macro that can be held in a Roll20 Character Sheet Ability Macro and be displayed in the Chat Window when called.  Typically, this will use a Roll Template (standard Roll20 functionality - see Roll20 Help for information), but it can be any format you desire as long as it results in the correct display of information to the Player.</p>'
							+'<p>The Attack Template has a large number of template fields that it can call upon to use in its calculations - these are pre-calculated values supplied by the API that the DM / Game Creator writing a new Attack Template can use.  The standard Roll20 attribute value notation of @{selected|field-name} is not recommended for use in Attack Templates, as when the template is parsed, and then later the resulting Ability Macro run as part of the attack, there are circumstances where the token for the attacking Character may not be currently selected, resulting in the wrong value being used or, worse, an error occurring and the game halting.  Instead, all the following template fields are available:</p>'

							+'<h2>5. Character (PC & NPC) Attack Templates</h2>'
							+'<p>As previously described, the Attacks Database contains Attack Templates as Ability Macro entries.  For Characters and NPCs that attack using weapons "in-hand" (see AttackMaster API documentation for information on taking weapons "in-hand"), four standard Attack Templates are required: -ToHit; -DmgSM; -DmgL; and -Targeted-Attk.</p>'
							+'<h3>5.1 The "To Hit" Template</h3>'
							+'<p>A standard <i>To Hit</i> Attack Template looks like this (the example is for the AD&D2e version):</p>'
							+'<h4>MW-ToHit</h4>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;"><b>^^toWhoPublic^^</b> &{template:<b>^^defaultTemplate^^</b>}{{title=<b>^^tname^^</b> attacks with their <b>^^weapon^^</b>}}{{subtitle=Melee Attack}}{{Weapon Used=<b>^^weapon^^</b>}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[MWtoHit,AttackMacro,1d20,Attack]</mark><span style="color:red">!setattr --silent --charid <b>^^cid^^</b> --ac-hit|</span>{{AC Hit=[[([[<b>^^thac0^^</b>]][Thac0]) - ((([[<b>^^weapAttkAdj^^</b>]][Weapon+]) + ([[<b>^^weapStyleAdj^^</b>]][Style+]) + ([[(<b>^^strAttkBonus^^</b> * <b>^^weapStrHit^^</b>)]][Strength+]) + ([[<b>^^profPenalty^^</b>]][Prof Penalty] + [[<b>^^specProf^^</b>]][Specialist] + [[<b>^^masterProf^^</b>*3]][Mastery]) + ([[<b>^^raceBonus^^</b>]][Race mod]) + ([[<b>^^magicAttkAdj^^</b>]][Magic hit adj]) + ([[<b>^^twoWeapPenalty^^</b>]][2-weap penalty]))) - ([[<b>^^toHitRoll^^</b>cs><b>^^weapCritHit^^</b>cf\<<b>^^weapCritMiss^^</b>]][Dice roll]) ]] }}<span style="color:red">!!!</span>{{Attk Type=<b>^^weapType^^</b>}}{{Dmg S=[Roll](~<b>^^mwSMdmgMacro^^</b>)}}{{Dmg L=[Roll](~<b>^^mwLHdmgMacro^^</b>)}}{{Crit Roll=<b>^^weapCritHit^^</b>}}{{Fumble Roll=<b>^^weapCritMiss^^</b>}}</pre>'
							+'<p>The four fields in the <i>Specs</i> data are the standard four used in all Specs fields: Entry Type (MWtoHit), Entry Class (AttackMacro), Handedness (in this case replaced by toHit dice roll spec 1d20), and Entry Supertype (Attack).  The key field to note here is the <b>ToHit Dice Roll Specification</b> (which replaces the <i>Handedness</i> field).  This can be any valid dice roll, and will be used for the <i>^^toHitRoll^^</i> template field if the Player selects Roll20 to roll the attack dice.</p>'
							+'<p>This Attack Template is formatted using a Roll20 Roll Template with a type specified using the <i>^^defaultTemplate^^</i> template field, but need not be - formatting is up to the creator of the Attack Template.  It is important this information is displayed to the right people - Players that control a character, all Players as a public post, or just the DM for attacks by creatures & NPCs.  The <i>^^toWhoPublic^^</i> template field will check if the attacking token represents a Character/NPC/Creature controlled by a Player and, if so, make a public post that all can see, but otherwise just whisper the results of the attack to the DM only.  Similarly, <i>^^toWho^^</i> will whisper the attack information either only to the Player(s) that control the attacking character/creature or, if no one does, then to the DM.</p>'
							+'<p>The rest of the Attack Template defines the calculations using the API supplied data to display the Armour Class value that would be successfully hit by the attacking character, with the selected weapon under the current conditions.  It also defines a display of the adjustments that are made to the dice roll which the Players and DM can hover a mouse over to get an explanation of the calculations.  All the calculations and tag display are standard Roll20 functionality, so once the Attack Template Data Fields are replaced by actual values by the API and the resulting Ability Macro saved to the attacking character\'s Character Sheet, running it like any other Ability Macro will use only Roll20 functionality, and not involve use of the APIs (unless the Attack template specifically includes an API call).</p>'
							+'<p>The Attack Template shown above is a To Hit template for a <b><i>Melee weapon</i></b> attack.  That for a <b><i>Ranged weapon</i></b> attack is very similar, just using some different and ranged attack related Template Fields.</p>'
							+'<h3>5.2 The "Damage" Templates</h3>'
							+'<p>There are always two damage Attack Templates to go with each <i>To Hit</i> Template, typically one for damage to Medium and smaller opponents and one for Large and larger.  However, as will be seen when discussing the <i>Oil Flask</i> bespoke Attack Templates below, those are not always the outcomes of the two damage Templates.  However, they <i>do</i> always start with MW-DmgSM and MW-DmgL for Melee weapon attacks, and RW-DmgSM and RW-DmgL for Ranged weapon attacks (optionally followed by a race, class or weapon name). The standard <i>Damage</i> Attack Template looks like this:</p>'
							+'<h4>MW-DmgSM</h4>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;"><b>^^toWhoPublic^^</b> &{template:<b>^^defaultTemplate^^</b>}{{title=<b>^^tname^^</b> does damage with their <b>^^weapon^^</b>}}{{Subtitle=Melee Attack}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[MWtoHit,AttackMacro,1d20,Attack]</mark>{{AC Hit=@{<b>^^cname^^</b>|ac-hit}}}{{Attk Type=<b>^^weapType^^</b>}}{{Dmg S=[[ ([[<b>^^weapDmgSM^^</b>]][Dice Roll]) + ([[<b>^^strDmgBonus^^</b>*<b>^^weapStrDmg^^</b>]][Strength+]) + ([[<b>^^weapDmgAdj^^</b>]][Weapon+]) + ([[<b>^^weapStyleDmgAdj^^</b>+<b>^^weapStyleDmgSM^^</b>]][Style+]) + ([[<b>^^magicDmgAdj^^</b>]][Magic dmg adj]) + ([[<b>^^specProf^^</b>*2]][Specialist+] + [[<b>^^masterProf^^</b>*3]][Mastery+])]]}}{{Dmg L=[Roll](~<b>^^mwLHdmgMacro^^</b>)}}{{Crit Roll=<b>^^weapCritHit^^</b>}}{{Fumble Roll=<b>^^weapCritMiss^^</b>}}</p>'
							+'<p>The damage Attack Template works in the same way as the other Attack Templates as explained above for the <i>ToHit</i> template.  While the <i>Specs</i> data includes the "To Hit" dice roll specification, this is not used in the damage Template, and is irrelevant.  That field just needs to hold something, and a dice roll specification is what is expected.  Hopefully, the rest of this damage Attack Template is self explanatory.</p>'
							+'<h2>6. Monster Attack Templates</h2>'
							+'<p>If a creature specified as a Monster on the Character Sheet uses in-hand weapons, as supported under the RPGMaster APIs, attacks with those weapons (Melee or Ranged) will use the standard <i>To Hit</i> and <i>Damage</i> Attack Templates described above.  However, attacks by creatures that are specified as Monsters (e.g. on the Monster tab of the Advanced 2nd Edition character sheet) are generally much simpler than character attacks with in-hand weapons.  The differences mean that such creatures require different Attack Templates.  Attacks specified on the Monster tab use the Monster Attack Templates: Mon-Attk, Mon-DmgSM, and Mon-DmgL (or the Targeted Attack Templates, see later).  Remember that the AttackMaster API supports an extension of the Monster Attk fields on the Advanced 2nd Edition Character Sheet: each can contain a comma-separated list consisting of "attack name","dice roll","speed in segments","damage type" (see AttackMaster Help for details).</p>'
							+'<p>The Monster Attack and Damage Templates look like this:</p>'
							+'<h4>Mon-Attk</h4>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;"><b>^^toWhoPublic^^</b> &{template:<b>^^defaultTemplate^^</b>}{{title=<b>^^tname^^</b> attacks with their <b>^^attk^^</b>}}{{subtitle=Monster Attack}}{{Weapon Used=<b>^^attk^^</b>}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[MonAttk,AttackMacro,1d20,Attack]</mark><span style="color:red">!setattr --silent --charid <b>^^cid^^</b> --ac-hit|{{AC Hit=[[</span>([[<b>^^thac0^^</b>]][Thac0]) - ([[<b>^^magicAttkAdj^^</b>]][Magic hit adj]) - ([[<b>^^toHitRoll^^</b>cs\><b>^^monsterCritHit^^</b>cf\<<b>^^monsterCritMiss^^</b>]][Dice roll]) ]]}}<span style="color:red">!!!</span>{{Attk Type=<b>^^weapType^^</b>}}{{Dmg S=[Roll](~<b>^^monsterDmgMacroSM^^</b>)}}{{Dmg L=[Roll](~<b>^^monsterDmgMacroL^^</b>)}}{{Crit Roll=<b>^^monsterCritHit^^</b>}}{{Fumble Roll=<b>^^monsterCritMiss^^</b>}}</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h4>Mon-DmgL</h4>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;"><b>^^toWhoPublic^^</b> &{template:<b>^^defaultTemplate^^</b>}{{title=<b>^^tname^^</b> does damage with their <b>^^attk^^</b>}}{{subtitle=Monster Attack}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[MonRoll,AttackMacro,1d20,Attack]</mark>{{AC Hit=[[@{<b>^^cname^^</b>|ac-hit}[AC Hit] ]]}}{{Attk Type=<b>^^weapType^^</b>}}{{Dmg L=[[(([[<b>^^monsterDmg^^</b>]][<b>^^attk^^</b> Dmg])+([[<b>^^magicDmgAdj^^</b>]][Added Magic Dmg]))]]}}{{Dmg S=[Roll](~<b>^^monsterDmgMacroSM^^</b>)}}{{Crit Roll=<b>^^monsterCritHit^^</b>}}{{Fumble Roll=<b>^^monsterCritMiss^^</b>}}</p>'
							+'<p>Unsurprisingly, these work in exactly the same way as other Attack Templates.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>7. Targeted Attack Templates</h2>'
							+'<p>The AttackMaster API supports the DM (and optionally, Players) using "targeted attacks".  This is an attack that prompts the DM / Player to select a target token, and then performs all attack and damage dice rolls at the same time, displaying the attack results alongside the Armour Class and relative health of the targeted opponent.  This speeds the attack process even further than having the API do all the attack calculations.  <b>Note:</b> the results of the attack <i>are not</i> applied to the targeted opponent - the results are still open to interpretation by the Players and DM, and circumstantial adjustment before manually applying them to the Token / Character Sheet of the opponent.</p>'
							+'<p>The Ranged weapon Targeted Attack Template for AD&D2e (for example) looks like this:</p>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;"><b>^^toWhoPublic^^</b> &{template:<b>^^defaultTemplate^^</b>}{{title=<b>^^tname^^</b> attacks @{Target|Select Target|Token_name} with their <b>^^weapon^^</b>}}{{subtitle=Ranged Attack &#42; **Ammo Left: <b>^^ammoLeft^^</b>**}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[RWtargetedAttk,AttackMacro,1d20,Attack]</mark>{{AC Hit=[[([[<b>^^thac0^^</b>]][Thac0])-(([[<b>^^weapAttkAdj^^</b>]][Weapon+]) + ([[<b>^^ammoDmgAdj^^</b>]][Ammo+]) + ([[<b>^^weapStyleAdj^^</b>]][Style+]) + ([[ <b>^^weapDexBonus^^</b>*[[<b>^^dexMissile^^</b>]]]][Dexterity+] )+([[[[<b>^^strAttkBonus^^</b>]]*[[<b>^^weapStrHit^^</b>]]]][Strength+])+([[<b>^^raceBonus^^</b>]][Race mod])+([[<b>^^profPenalty^^</b>]][Prof penalty])+([[<b>^^magicAttkAdj^^</b>]][Magic Hit+])+([[<b>^^twoWeapPenalty^^</b>]][2-weap penalty])+([[<b>^^rangeMod^^</b>]][Range mod]))-([[<b>^^toHitRoll^^</b>cs\><b>^^weapCritHit^^</b>cf\<<b>^^weapCritMiss^^</b>]][Dice roll]) ]] }}{{Attk Type=<b>^^weapType^^</b>}}{{Target AC=<b>^^targetACmissile^^</b>}}{{Target SAC=<b>^^ACvsSlashMissile^^</b>}}{{Target PAC=<b>^^ACvsPierceMissile^^</b>}}{{Target BAC=<b>^^ACvsBludgeonMissile^^</b>}}{{Dmg S=[[ floor( ([[<b>^^ammoDmgSM^^</b>]][Dice roll]) * ([[(^^rangeN^^*0.5)+(^^rangePB^^*(1+^^masterProfPB^^))+(^^rangeSMLF^^*1)]][Range mult])) + ([[<b>^^rangePB^^</b>*<b>^^masterProfPB^^</b>*2]][Range mod]) + (([[<b>^^ammoDmgAdj^^</b>]][Ammo+])+([[<b>^^ammoStyleDmgAdj^^</b>+<b>^^ammoStyleDmgSM^^</b>]][Style+])+([[<b>^^magicDmgAdj^^</b>]][Magic dmg+]) +([[<b>^^strDmgBonus^^</b>*<b>^^ammoStrDmg^^</b>]][Strength+])) ]]}}{{Dmg L=[[ floor( ([[<b>^^ammoDmgSM^^</b>]][Dice roll]) * ([[(<b>^^rangeN^^</b>*0.5)+(<b>^^rangePB^^</b>*(1+<b>^^masterProfPB^^</b>))+(<b>^^rangeSMLF^^</b>*1)]][Range mult])) + ([[<b>^^rangePB^^</b>*<b>^^masterProfPB^^</b>*2]][Range mod]) + (([[<b>^^ammoDmgAdj^^</b>]][Ammo+])+([[<b>^^ammoStyleDmgAdj^^</b>+<b>^^ammoStyleDmgL^^</b>]][Style+])+([[<b>^^magicDmgAdj^^</b>]][Magic dmg+]) +([[<b>^^strDmgBonus^^</b>*<b>^^ammoStrDmg^^</b>]][Strength+])) ]]}}{{Target HP=^<b>^targetHP^^</b>}}{{Target MaxHP=<b>^^targetMaxHP^^</b>}}{{Target Heart=<b>^^targetHP^^</b>/<b>^^targetMaxHP^^</b>}}{{Crit Roll=<b>^^weapCritHit^^</b>}}{{Fumble Roll=<b>^^weapCritMiss^^</b>}}{{Result=AC Hit\<=Target AC}}</p>'
							+'<p>The key difference, other than doing all of the calculations for the Armour Class hit and both the damage for Medium and smaller and Large and larger, is that several of the Template Fields used resolve to appropriately formatted Roll20 <i>@{target|...}</i> entries, that will display values from the targeted opponent\'s token and/or character sheet.  The API searches for the most appropriate token and character sheet fields to resolve the targeted Template Fields to (it searches the attacking creature\'s data, and assumes all tokens are set up the same way): if using the standard RPGMaster token settings (as set by the <b>CommandMaster API --abilities</b> command or [Token Setup] DM\'s Macro button) it will find the data it needs on the token; otherwise it will first search other token fields, then standard Character Sheet character tab fields, then Character Sheet monster tab fields.  If the API can\'t find AC or HP data, it will display appropriate text saying the data was not found, but will not cause an error.  Thus it is sensible to use these Template Fields rather than statically defined <i>@{target|...}</i> commands.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>8. Bespoke / Custom Attack Templates</h2>'
							+'<p>All of the above examples and discussion have explored the standard Attack Templates distributed with the AttackMaster API.  It will be the case that this will cater for around 95% of attacks and attack-like situations (e.g. there is a weapon called "Touch" which Spell Casters can use for touch-attack spells, which uses the standard Attack Templates without change to achieve the needed outcome).  However, for that other 5% (or perhaps closer to 1%) of special cases you can define your own bespoke or custom Attack Templates.  Being able to change the way attacks are calculated is also essential if you wish to adapt the API to work for game systems other than those for which RPGMaster Library rulesets currently exist.</p>'
							+'<p>As stated in Section 1, you <i>should not</i> add Attack Templates to the <i>Attacks-DB</i> database directly. Instead, create your own Character Sheet named <i>Attack-DB-[any-name-you-want]</i> and add Attack Templates to it. If you want to replace the Attack Templates provided for Melee weapons, Ranged weapons and/or Monster attacks, just create ones in your added database with the same Ability Macro name and they will automatically be used in preference to the standard versions.</p>'
							+'<p>As also mentioned previously, while Attack Templates are always called with names of the format given in Section 3, they do not have to result in standard attacks or damage - the calculations and resulting information provided to players can be whatever is needed as a result of that attack action.  An example of this is included in the distributed <i>Attacks-DB</i>, the <b>Oil Flask Attack Template set</b>:</p>'
							+'<h4>RW-ToHit-Oil-Flask</h4>'

							+'<p>The <i>To Hit</i> Attack Template is very similar to a normal Ranged weapon Attack Template, except that instead of API buttons indicating damage rolls vs. different sized opponents, it provides one API button to select a [Direct Hit], and another selecting a [Grenade/Splash] outcome.  Each of these still calls the same damage Attack Templates using the Template Fields provided but in this case, because the attack is with a weapon called <i>Oil Flask</i>, the Template Fields will resolve to calls to <b>RW-DmgSM-Oil-Flask</b> and <b>RW-DmgL-Oil-Flask</b> respectively, and these custom Attack Templates do damage in a very different way to a normal Ranged Weapon attack.</p>'

							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster APIs use a number of databases to hold Ability Macros defining rules, conditions and benefits of various styles of fighting with weapons and shields, defined in the RPGMaster Library for various game versions. Databases supplied with the APIs are held internally to the APIs. However, the AttackMaster or MagicMaster API command <b>--extract-db</b> can be used to extract any or all standard databases to Character Sheets for examination and update. DMs can add their own fighting style definitions to additional databases held as Character Sheets. Additional databases should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table><tr><td>Fighting Styles:</td><td>additional databases: Styles-DB-[added name] where [added name] can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr></table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. Styles-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want.  Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> databases extracted using the <b>--extract-db</b> command will be able to be edited, but will also slow the system down - the versions held internally in the APIs are much faster for the system to access. Once any extracted database has been examined, it is best to delete them and use the <b>--check-db</b> to re-index the databases so the system operates as fast as possible.</p>'
							+'<p>Each database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul><li>Ability Macros named as the fighting style specified, and used to describe and provide specifications for using the commands with the AttackMaster API;</li>'
							+'<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the speed and type for each item;</li>'
							+'<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (various spell books for different items - see entry below);</li>'
							+'<li>Optionally, some entries come also with attributes that define Powers and Spells delivered by or stored on the item (irrelevant for fighting styles).</li></ul>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> a DM only needs to program the Ability Macro using the formats shown in the next section, and then run the <b>!attk --check-db</b> or <b>!magic --check-db</b> command, which will correctly parse the ability macro and set the rest of the database entries as needed.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired, as long as they include the required information specified below. Roll Templates are very useful when defining ability macros - the RPGMaster Library provides several new Roll Templates that do not rely on any particular Character Sheet: <i>RPGMdefault</i> is the most relevant. See the RPGMaster Library help handout for further information.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster views the specifications of a fighting style the APIs run the relevant Ability Macro from the database as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Provided Styles</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any style provided in the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases with exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<h2>2. Fighting Style Databases</h2>'
							+'<p>Fighting style databases have names that start with Styles-DB, and can have anything put at the end, though those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated, each style definition has 3 (or 4) parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and matches the style, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with other fighting styles. The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract the root databases and take a look (but remember to delete them after exploring the items in them, so as not to slow the system down unnecessarily).</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new weapons does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the <b>AttackMaster</b> or <b>MagicMaster -check-db Styles-DB</b> command will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases that have a name starting with or including <i>\'Styles-DB\'</i>, as long as the <i>Specs</i> and <i>Data</i> fields are correctly defined.  Running the command <b>-check-db</b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>The Styles-DB database provided with the APIs contains standard definitions for the four fighting styles defined in <i>The Complete Fighter\'s Handbook</i>, plus a couple of other examples for Ranged weapons to demonstrate how other styles can be defined.  After extracting the provided Styles database or creating your own as discussed above, aAbility macros can be added to a database just by using the [+Add] button at the top of the Abilities column in the Attributes and Abilities tab of the Database Character Sheet, and then using the edit "pencil" icon on the new entry to open it for editing.  Ability macros are standard Roll20 functionality and not dependent on the API.  Refer to the Roll20 Help Centre for more information.</p>'

							+'<h3>Weapon & Shield Style</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMdefault}{{name=Two Weapon Fighting Style}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[Two Weapon,Style,2H,Melee-Style]</mark>{{desc=With this popular style, the fighter has a weapon in each hand—usually a longer weapon in his good hand and a shorter one in his off-hand. Unless the character has Style Specialization in this style, the second (off-hand) weapon must be shorter than the primary weapon.}}<mark style="color:blue">StyleData=[prime:melee, offhand:melee, t:any, st:any],[twp:0.2],[twp:0.2]</mark>{{desc1=**Advantages**<br>'
							+'One great advantage to this style is that you always have another weapon in hand if you drop or lose one. A single Disarm maneuver cannot rid you of your weapons.}}{{desc2=**Disadvantages**<br>'
							+'The principal disadvantage to this style, as with some other styles, is that you don\'t gain the AC benefit of a shield.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**<br>'
							+'Please read the "Attacking with Two Weapons" section from the Player\'s Handbook, page 96, before continuing.<br>'
							+'If you devote a weapon proficiency slot to style specialization with Two-Weapon Style, you get two important benefits. First, your attack penalty drops; before, it was a –2 with your primary weapon and –4 with your secondary, but with Specialization in Two-Weapon Style it becomes 0 with your primary weapon and a –2 with your secondary weapon. (If you\'re already ambidextrous, that penalty is 0 with primary weapon and 0 with secondary weapon). Second, you\'re allowed to use weapons of the same length in each hand, so you can, for example, wield two long swords.<br>'
							+'When fighting with two-weapon technique, you can choose for both weapons to try the same maneuver (for example, two strikes, or two disarms), or can have each try a different maneuver (one strike and one parry, one pin and one strike). If the two maneuvers are to be different, each receives a –1 attack penalty.<br>'
							+'Though rangers don\'t suffer the off-hand penalties for two-weapons use, they do not get a bonus to attack rolls if they devote a weapon proficiency slot to Two-Weapon Style. They do get the other benefit, of being able to use weapons of equal length.}}</p>'
							+'<p>The ability specification for the Weapon & Shield Fighting Style uses a Roll20 Roll Template, in this case defined in the RPGMaster Library (see the help handout for the Library to review the specifications of this template), but any Roll Template you desire can be used.  The entries in the Roll Template itself can be anything you desire, giving as much or as little information as you want.  However, the important elements for the APIs are those highlighted.  Each of these elements are inserted <i>between</i> the elements of the Roll Template, meaning they will not be seen by the player when the macro is run.  Generally spaces, hyphens and underscores in the data elements are ignored, and case is not significant.  Each element is described below:</p>'

							+'<br>'
							+'<p>Here is another example showing how the keys <i>oneh</i> and <i>twoh</i> are used in combination with other keys to implement the Two-Hander Style:</p>'
							+'<h3>Two-Hander Style</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMdefault}{{name=Two Hander Fighting Style}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[Two Hander,Style,2H,Melee-style]</mark>{{desc=Two-Hander Style involves carrying and wielding a weapon with both hands. Naturally, many weapons (including polearms, the great axe, the two-handed sword, and others) require two-handed technique. Other weapons (such as bastard sword, javelin, and spear) have it as a listed option.}}<mark style="color:blue">StyleData=[twohand:melee, weaps:any],[1H:dmg=+1, 2H:mwsp=-3],[1H:dmg=+1, 2H:mwsp=-3]</mark>{{desc1=**Advantages**<br>'
							+'The main advantage of two-handed weapon technique is that it allows the character to wield large two-handed weapons which can do substantial amounts of damage. <br>'
							+'A second advantage is that, if you are using a two-handed weapon, the Disarm maneuver is only of partial use against you. A single successful Disarm against a two-handed weapon user won\'t knock the weapon out of the wielder\'s hands; it will merely knock his weapon askew and make him take some time to recover, so he automatically loses initiative on his next round. However, two Disarm maneuvers successfully made against the character in the same round will knock the weapon loose.}}{{desc2=**Disadvantages**<br>'
							+'As with single-weapon use, two-handed weapon technique has the drawback that the user cannot wear or use a shield, or gain the shield\'s AC bonus.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**<br>'
							+'You can, by devoting a weapon proficiency to it, take a Style Specialization with Two-Hander Style.<br>'
							+'Style Specialization with Two-Hander Style gives you a very specific benefit: When you\'re using a weapon two-handed, that weapon\'s Speed Factor is reduced by 3.<br>'
							+'This is because when a fighter wields such a weapon with both hands on the hilt, he has more leverage on the blade and can move it faster. That\'s what Style Specialization in Two-Hander Style will do for the character: It teaches him how to use the weapon much faster and more aggressively than someone with less specialized training in the weapon.}}{{desc4=**One-Handed Weapons Used Two-Handed**<br>'
							+'Some players don\'t realize that many other one-handed weapons can also be used two-handed. If you specialize in Two-Hander Style and then use a one-handed weapon in two hands, you also get a bonus of +1 to damage. The one-handed weapons which can be used two-handed in this fashion include: Battle axe, Club, Footman\'s flail, Footman\'s pick, Horseman\'s flail, Horseman\'s mace, Horseman\'s pick, Morning star, Long sword, Warhammer.}}</p>'
							+'<p>Here the data specification is:</p>'
							+'<pre>StyleData=[twohand:melee, weaps:any],[1H:dmg=+1, 2H:mwsp=-3],[1H:dmg=+1, 2H:mwsp=-3]</pre>'
							+'<p>This specifies that there must be a melee weapon equipped in the [Both Hands] slot, and if this is a two-handed weapon then the melee weapon speed is improved by 3 segments.  However, if the weapon in the [Both Hands] slot is one of the few one-handed weapons allowed to be taken in both hands (as defined in The Complete Fighter\'s Handbook for this style), then instead it will gain +1 to the damage it inflicts. In this case, the same benefits apply whether the character is just proficient or specialist in the Two-Hander Style.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> only cetain one-handed weapons can be taken in both hands. Indeed, only certain one-handd weapons will appear in the weapon list shown when the [Both Hands] button is selected on the <i>Change Weapon</i> menu. This is achieved in the weapon specifications in the Weapons Database. For full details, see the explanation given in the <i>Weapons & Armour Database Help</i> handout. In summary, a one-handed weapon which can be wielded two-handed and gain Two-Hander Fighting Style benefits, such as a Battle Axe, requires a second <i>Specs</i> dataset with the \'2H\' attribute, but <b><i>no additional ToHitData datasets.</i></b>  This informs the APIs that this weapon can be taken in both hands, but will not gain any benefits from doing so (unlike, e.g. a Bastard Sword) unless the Character has proficiency in the Two-Hander Fighting Style.</p>'
							+'<p>Other styles can be defined that are not specified in <i>The Complete Fighter\'s Handbook</i>, and some examples are provided in the distributed database:</p>'
							+'<h3>Bowyer Style</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMdefault}{{name=Bowyer Fighting Style}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[Bowyer,Style,2H,Ranged-style]</mark>{{desc=Bowyer Fighting Style reflects fighters who practice day in, day out at the range perfecting their use of bows of all types.}}<mark style="color:blue">StyleData=[twohand:ranged, weaps:bow],[rwr:+1/+1/+2/+3,rwsp:-2],[rwr:+1/+1/+3/+5,rwsp:-3,rwn:+1/2]</mark>{{desc1=**Advantages**<br>'
							+'The main advantage of bowyer technique is that it allows the character to wield two-handed bows which can do damage at long ranges, staying out of melee and making you a difficult enemy to attack.}}{{desc2=**Disadvantages**<br>'
							+'As with any two-handed weapon use use, bowyer weapon technique has the drawback that the user cannot wear or use a shield, or gain the shield\'s AC bonus.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**<br>'
							+'You can, by devoting a weapon proficiency to it, take a Style Specialization with Bowyer Style.<br>'
							+'Style Specialization with Bowyer Style enables you to extend your accuracy at range by 10 yards at short range, 20 at medium and 30 at long range, and improve the speed of the bow by 2 segments. As their skill improves further (by dedicating two proficiency slots), range increases further (by 30 yards at medium and 50 at long), and nocking arrows and drawing the bow faster to enable them to get additional attack every other round}}</p>'
							+'<p>This style has a slightly more complex data specification:</p>'
							+'<pre>StyleData=[twohand:ranged, weaps:bow],[rwr:+1/+1/+2/+3,rwsp:-2],[rwr:+1/+1/+3/+5,rwsp:-3,rwn:+1/2]</pre>'
							+'<p>You can see here the application of the restriction of this fighting style to two-handed ranged weapons that belong to the weapon group <i>bow</i>, then applying benefits using the range extension key <i>rwr</i>, the ranged weapon speed modifier <i>rwsp</i>, and improving the number of attacks for a ranged weapon by one attack per two rounds using <i>rwn</i>.</p>'
							+'<p>A wide range of fighting styles can be created using the different combination of rules and benefits, to enrich the game you create, and your players experience.
